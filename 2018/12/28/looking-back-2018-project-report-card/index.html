  <p>Over the last five years or so, I&rsquo;ve shared with my readers an annual list of projects along with&mdash;at the year&rsquo;s end&mdash;a &ldquo;project report card&rdquo; on how I fared against the projects I&rsquo;d set for myself. (For example, here&rsquo;s <a href="/2018/01/03/looking-back-2017-project-report-card/">my project report card for 2017</a>.) Following that same pattern, then, here is my project report card for 2018.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the list of projects I established for myself in 2018 (you can also read <a href="/2018/03/05/looking-ahead-2018-projects/">the associated blog post</a> for more context):</p>
<ol>
<li>Become extremely fluent in Kubernetes. <em>(Stretch goal: Pass the CKA exam.)</em></li>
<li>Learn to code/develop in Go.</li>
<li>Make three contributions to open source projects. <em>(Stretch goal: Make five contributions.)</em></li>
<li>Read and review three technical books. <em>(Stretch goal: Read and review five technical books.)</em></li>
<li>Complete a &ldquo;wildcard&rdquo; project.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, how did I do? Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Become extremely fluent in Kubernetes:</em> This is, in my opinion, a hard one to accurately gauge. Why? Well, Kubernetes is a pretty massive project. I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/caffeinepresent/status/1072915461560365057">a tweet</a> recently saying the project was now at a point where no one person can understand all of it. The other factor making it difficult for me to accurately gauge this is the caliber of folks with whom I&rsquo;m working. I mean, the people on my team are <em>amazing</em> and extremely talented. So, while I made tremendous gains in my Kubernetes knowledge over the course of 2018, can I consider myself fluent, much less extremely fluent? I think I did reasonably well, but I don&rsquo;t think I can consider myself extremely fluent. Grade: <strong>C</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Learn to code/develop in Go:</em> In <a href="/2018/07/23/bolstering-my-software-development-skills/">the post announcing my Polyglot project</a> (aimed to help bolster my development/programming skills), I admitted that this was a tall task to take on and that I&rsquo;d most likely need to, in my own words, &ldquo;learn to walk (or even crawl!) before I can run.&rdquo; Although I have improved in my ability to read Golang code and (sometimes) understand what it is doing, my ability to write useful Golang code is still severely lacking. Grade: <strong>D</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Make three contributions to open source projects:</em> I&rsquo;m very pleased to report that my contributions to open source projects have increased significantly during 2018. This past year, I&rsquo;ve made contributions&mdash;in the form of actual commits as well as in the form of opening issues&mdash;to <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy">Sonobuoy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/heptiolabs/wardroom/">Wardroom</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/heptio/ark/">Ark</a>. Looking only at committed changes, I submitted more than 5 pull requests to Wardroom and Ark, meaning that I achieved my &ldquo;stretch goal&rdquo; of making at least five contributions to open source projects. Grade: <strong>A</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Read and review three technical books:</em> I got close on this one, but only completed 2 technical books (see <a href="/2018/05/31/book-review-infrastructure-as-code/">here</a> and <a href="/2018/09/04/book-review-rest-api-design-rulebook/">here</a> for the reviews). I&rsquo;m still working on Sam Newman&rsquo;s <em>Building Microservices</em> book, but have just been too busy to finish it out and write a review. Had I gotten a more timely start on my 2018 projects, I might have been able to finish out all three. Grade: <strong>B</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Complete a &ldquo;wildcard&rdquo; project:</em> In looking back over 2018, I don&rsquo;t really see anything that would qualify as a &ldquo;wildcard project.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not to say I didn&rsquo;t make progress in areas other than those listed above; I grew tremendously in my knowledge and application of cloud-native projects <em>other</em> than just Kubernetes; I migrated to Linux full-time in April when I joined Heptio (and recently converted <a href="/2018/12/19/running-fedora-on-my-mac-pro/">my Mac Pro workstation to Fedora</a>, taking another big step forward); I expanded my knowledge and use of Linux containers for various use cases; I learned about RAML and API specifications; and deepened my skills with various infrastructure-as-code tools. These are all valuable things, but none of them rise (in my opinion) to the level of a &ldquo;wilcard project.&rdquo; Polyglot would qualify for one, had I spent more time working on it and gotten more done. However, I did say that I wouldn&rsquo;t penalize myself for not completing one. Grade: <strong>N/A</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary: not too bad, but there&rsquo;s still room to improve!</p>
<p>I do have a couple takeaways&mdash;lessons learned, if you will&mdash;from the pursuit of these projects over the course of 2018:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting concrete, specific, measurable goals for projects is still an area in which I can improve. I performed better in those areas where I had specific goals associated with each project.</li>
<li>Bolstering development skills is harder and more time-consuming than I anticipated. This is an area where I do want to continue to invest, but it&rsquo;s also an area where following the lessons learning in the previous bullet (e.g., setting specific and measurable goals) are really difficult. What <em>is</em> an effective goal with something like this&ndash;lines of code written?</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next week or two I&rsquo;ll be evaluating potential projects&mdash;and associated goals that are specific and measurable&mdash;for 2019. Look for my list of 2019 projects in mid-January 2019.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
