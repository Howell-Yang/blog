  <p>I first started getting into <a href="https://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a> around 2003, possibly earlier (I can&rsquo;t recall exactly when it was). I remember thinking that VMware&rsquo;s impact on the industry was going to be significant, and I wanted to be part of this industry change. I was right&mdash;virtualization like what VMware offers has fundamentally changed the industry. However, just as technology evolves, technology careers must evolve as well. Specifically, my technology career must change and grow. It&rsquo;s time to evolve.</p>
<p>This need to evolve has been building for a couple years. You&rsquo;ve probably observed that the amount of VMware-centric content produced here on the site has slowly been replaced by topics like Linux, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a>, and others. These topics represent where I think my next period of growth and change resides, and after a couple years of slow growth in these areas it&rsquo;s now time to &ldquo;put the pedal to the metal&rdquo; and accelerate things.</p>
<p>As of this coming Friday, March 30, 2018, I will be leaving VMware after a little over 5 years with the company. My time with VMware (as an employee) has been an amazing adventure. I&rsquo;m thankful to Brad Hedlund for his Twitter DM asking me, &ldquo;Would you be interested in talking to Martin Casado?&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m thankful to Martin for giving me an opportunity to be part of the network virtualization vanguard at VMware. I&rsquo;ve met some incredible people, learned many things, worked with amazing teams, and contributed to important projects.</p>
<p>Not only am I leaving VMware as an employee, but I&rsquo;m also leaving VMware as a focus area. After about 15 years of being focused almost exclusively on VMware products and platforms, I&rsquo;m stepping away from VMware to focus and concentrate on a new technology direction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk more about my new focus next week when I announce where I&rsquo;m headed following my departure from VMware. Naturally, this decision to focus on a new technology direction means some changes. Often, in order to say &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; one must also say &ldquo;no.&rdquo; In this particular case, in order to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to focusing on a new technology direction, I must say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to being well-versed in VMware&rsquo;s products and platforms. Similarly, in order to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to being an engaged member of a new technical community, I must say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to being closely involved in the VMware community.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, the VMware community that I will miss the most; it&rsquo;s been part of my professional life for more than a few years. So, what does this mean? Moving forward, it won&rsquo;t make sense for me to be involved in user group events, and I probably won&rsquo;t continue to be a vExpert (2018 is already in the bag, marking a ten-year run, but 2019 probably won&rsquo;t happen&mdash;and that&rsquo;s OK). I don&rsquo;t foresee maintaining my VCDX. These are fully expected consequences of switching my focus away from VMware&rsquo;s platforms. Although I expect I will always have friends within the community, it simply doesn&rsquo;t make sense to be as active and involved as I have been in the past.</p>
<p>While I am saddened by the thought of not being so involved in the VMware community, I am encouraged by the opportunity to build relationships in a new community. I&rsquo;m hopeful that I can make a positive impact in some small way. That&rsquo;s my goal, anyway.</p>
<p>It probably goes without saying, but I&rsquo;ll continue to publish content here, although the content will (naturally) shift even further away from VMware-related topics. What can you expect to see? <a href="/2018/03/05/looking-ahead-2018-projects/">My list of 2018 projects/goals</a> provides a few clues. I&rsquo;ll continue to remain active <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lowe">on Twitter</a>, and there are a few different Slack communities where you&rsquo;re likely to spot me as well.</p>
<p>Change is an integral part of life, and it&rsquo;s an integral part of every person&rsquo;s career (or should be, anyway!). The time has come to embrace this change and make the most of the opportunity. It&rsquo;s time to evolve. Exciting times are ahead!</p>
