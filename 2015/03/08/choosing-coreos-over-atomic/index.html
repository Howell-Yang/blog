  <p>Upon hearing <a href="http://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-launches-red-hat-enterprise-linux-7-atomic-host-advances-linux-containers-enterprise">the news that Red Hat had released the Atomic Host variant of Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>, I decided that it would be a good idea for me to take a look at the <a href="https://www.centos.org">CentOS</a> flavor of the Atomic Host variant. In case you&rsquo;re unfamiliar, the Atomic Host variant is the result of <a href="http://www.projectatomic.io">Project Atomic</a>, which aimed to provide a container-optimized flavor of RHEL/CentOS/Fedora. This container-optimized flavor would leverage <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree">rpm-ostree</a> for atomic system updates (hence the name) and come with <a href="https://www.centos.org">Docker</a> preinstalled. What I found, frankly, disappointed me.</p>
<p>Before I continue, I will make two very important disclaimers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Note that there has been <em>no</em> official announcement of the release of final builds of an Atomic Host variant for CentOS 7. So, it&rsquo;s entirely possible that all the issues I mention here are known issues that will be addressed. That being said, I did find CentOS 7 Atomic Host builds dated March 5, 2015; this is the same date as the Red Hat announcement. It&rsquo;s reasonable, therefore, to believe that these builds are very close to final builds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s entirely possible these issues are the result of errors on my part. I&rsquo;ve spent most of my time with <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> (for general purpose Linux use cases) and <a href="https://coreos.com">CoreOS</a> (for container-optimized use cases). Therefore, it&rsquo;s definitely a possibility that my lack of familiarity with the &ldquo;RHEL/CentOS&rdquo; way of doing things led to some of the issues below.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With those two disclaimers out of the way, here are some general points that I noted about the CentOS 7 Atomic Host build I tested. (By the way, my testing was performed using <a href="http://www.openstack.org">OpenStack</a> Icehouse running KVM on Ubuntu 12.04, with virtual networking provided by <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/nsx/">VMware NSX</a>.)</p>
<ul>
<li>At some point (it&rsquo;s unclear exactly when it happened or why it happened) cloud-init on the Atomic Host instances just stopped working. It wasn&rsquo;t the back-end cloud-init service (being provided by OpenStack), as that continued to work for other distributions/images. In total, I deployed between 10 and 15 Atomic Host instances. Customization via cloud-init worked for some number of them, but at some point it failed and I was completely unable to make cloud-init work for any instances after that point. Reviewing the console logs would show a traceback for cloud-init, meaning that cloud-init had reported an error and halted. All the while, cloud-init was working fine for instances based on Ubuntu and CoreOS images. I suppose it is possible that the CentOS Atomic Host image was corrupted or damaged in some way; I haven&rsquo;t yet tried to replace the image with a fresh download to see if that fixes anything.</li>
<li>Once deployed, I found that the Docker daemon wouldn&rsquo;t start on Atomic Host instances. <code>systemctl -l status docker.service</code> would only report that the operation timed out, and <code>journalctl</code> didn&rsquo;t provide any additional detail. Rebooting the instance didn&rsquo;t help. Based on the results of some Internet searches, I thought perhaps the Docker daemon was having a problem setting up the default <code>docker0</code> bridge. Running <code>lsmod</code> showed that the iptables, conntrack, and nat kernel modules weren&rsquo;t loaded. Running Docker manually in non-daemon mode eventually (after waiting quite a while) caused those kernel modules to load (verified by running <code>lsmod</code> again), and at that point the Docker daemon would start via <code>systemctl</code>.</li>
<li>The CentOS Atomic Host instances appeared to periodically &ldquo;lock up&rdquo;; for example, attempting to SSH into the instance would occasionally result in a <em>very</em> long delay before getting logged in. I also experienced unexplained delays when running simple Docker commands (like <code>docker ps</code> to list containers once I had gotten Docker to work).</li>
<li>Project Atomic does not provide any Atomic-specific cloud-init extensions that might simplify the customization of Atomic Host instances. This makes it much harder to do tasks like configuring the Docker daemon to listen on a network port, for example. That&rsquo;s not to say that it&rsquo;s impossible to perform these tasks, just that it is (in my opinion) much more difficult than it should be.</li>
<li>Given that I couldn&rsquo;t automatically configure the Docker daemon to listen on a network port, I manually created the appropriate systemd socket unit. I verified that the Atomic Host instance was listening on port 2375, but all Docker commands sent to the daemon (via <code>docker -H tcp://&lt;IP address&gt;:2375</code>) simply hung. I verified there was no firewall configuration present that would cause the problem, but the issue persisted. I tried running Docker commands using <code>docker -H tcp://localhost:2375</code>, but those commands hung and become unresponsive as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, the CentOS Atomic Host variant felt <em>unfinished</em>. It felt as if, perhaps in response to pressure from CoreOS, that Red Hat and contributors rushed to retrofit their existing distribution into a &ldquo;container-optimized&rdquo; variation. In contrast, CoreOS feels much more mature, more polished, and more production ready as a container-optimized Linux distribution. This is reflected in the cloud-init/cloud-config extensions to easily create and modify systemd units and in the <em>consistency</em> of the distribution&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that the RHEL/CentOS Atomic Host variants will get better over time, but for now I&rsquo;m sticking with CoreOS.</p>
<h3 id="update">Update</h3>
<p>Since publishing this post, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to speak with someone from Red Hat to get some additional information, and I wanted to share that here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The officially-released version of RHEL Atomic Host is 7.1, <em>not</em> 7.0. Thus, the 7.0 builds of CentOS Atomic Host with which I was testing actually pre-dated the official release (and, in fact, are no longer available for download). CentOS 7.1 Atomic Host builds should be coming soon. When the 7.1 builds are available, I&rsquo;ll test it again.</li>
<li>Initial indications seem to point to an interaction between the use of rpm-ostree and cloud-init (version 0.7.5) as causing the cloud customization problems I described above. This isn&rsquo;t something the Red Hat team saw during their testing, but it&rsquo;s something into which they are currently looking.</li>
</ul>
<p>My sincere thanks goes to Steve Gordon for taking the time to talk with me about the issues that I uncovered.</p>
