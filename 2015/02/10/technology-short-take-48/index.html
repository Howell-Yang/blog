  <p>Welcome to Technology Short Take #48, another installation in my irregularly-published series that collects links, articles, and thoughts from around the web. This time around, the content is a bit heavier on cloud management and applications/operating systems, but still lots of good content all the way around (I hope, anyway).</p>
<h2 id="networking">Networking</h2>
<ul>
<li>Matt Oswalt recently wrapped up his 3-part &ldquo;DevOps for Networking&rdquo; series. I referenced part 1 of the series <a href="/2014/11/07/technology-short-take-46/">back in TST #46</a>, and parts 2 and 3 are just as good as the first one. Part 2 talks about <a href="http://keepingitclassless.net/2014/11/source-driven-configuration-netops/">source-driven configuration for NetOps</a> (which discusses the use of Git and Gerrit to manage network device configurations), while Part 3 walks through a <a href="http://keepingitclassless.net/2015/01/continuous-integration-pipeline-network/">continuous integration pipeline for networking</a> (which adds Jenkins to the mix described in part 2). Helpful and informative content, no question about it.</li>
<li>The NFV discussion seems to be heating up a bit, particularly the &ldquo;networking&rdquo; part of NFV. Craig Matsumoto of SDxCentral recently published <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/nfv-performance-bigger-issue/2015/01/">a piece on NFV performance</a>; that article was based largely on a blog post by Martin Taylor of Metaswitch found <a href="http://info.metaswitch.com/the-switch/tackling-the-nfv-packet-performance-challenge">here</a>. The key takeaway is that NFV networking performance requirements are something that projects like OpenStack and Open vSwitch (OVS) haven&rsquo;t yet fully addressed, though progress is being made (particularly on the OVS front, which will soon incorporate Intel&rsquo;s DPDK acceleration for &ldquo;substantial performance improvements&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Jason Edelman has posted a self-compiled <a href="http://www.jedelman.com/home/open-source-networking">list of networking projects that are open source</a>; this is a useful list, so thanks for compiling it Jason! I do have one thing to call out, though, and I apologize if I&rsquo;m showing my ignorance. I didn&rsquo;t think that OpenFlow itself was actually open source (even though there are multiple open source implementations of various OpenFlow products). Can anyone clarify for sure? A quick perusal of the ONF web site does not indicate that the OpenFlow materials are available anywhere under any open source license. (This isn&rsquo;t to say that they aren&rsquo;t freely available, just not available under an open source license.)</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of Socketplane.io, but may not have had the time to take a deeper look at what they are working on. Never fear, this site has <a href="http://aucouranton.com/2015/01/16/docker-virtual-networking-with-socketplane-io/">a walkthrough of the Socketplane.io tech preview</a> of virtual networks for Docker.</li>
<li>Tom Hollingworth has a nice article on <a href="http://networkingnerd.net/2015/01/27/more-bang-for-your-budget-with-whitebox/">getting more bang for the buck with whitebox networking gear</a>. Tom&rsquo;s key point is that disaggregating software from hardware&mdash;which is kind of a given if you&rsquo;re buying whitebox networking gear&mdash;gives you the (potential) flexibility to repurpose network gear based on the software running on it. The &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; is that these software stacks haven&rsquo;t been written yet, so the idea of repurposing hardware from switch to firewall to load balancer is still a bit of a unicorn. However, it&rsquo;s at least <em>possible</em> with whitebox networking gear.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="servershardware">Servers/Hardware</h2>
<p>I have nothing to share this time around, but I&rsquo;ll keep my eyes peeled for stuff to include in the future.</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>Here&rsquo;s a nice article on <a href="http://www.storagegumbo.com/2014/09/automation-multi-action-security.html">a multi-action security workflow</a> built using VMware NSX, vShield Endpoint, and vCenter Orchestrator.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cloud-computingcloud-management">Cloud Computing/Cloud Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>I came across a couple of useful vCloud Air-related posts that I wanted to share here. First, <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vcloud/2014/12/login-vcloud-air-linux-instances-using-ssh-keys.html">here&rsquo;s a workaround</a> to the fact that vCA doesn&rsquo;t (yet) do cloud-init, which makes injecting SSH keys into Linux instances a bit difficult. Hats off to Massimo for writing this up. Second, Paco Gómez has <a href="http://blog.pacogomez.com/running-containers-on-vcloud-air/">a write-up on running containers on vCloud Air</a> (using an Ubuntu instance). Thanks for the walkthrough, Paco!</li>
<li>Lars Kellogg-Stedman&mdash;who really puts out some very useful stuff, and was instrumental in helping me decode some of the Heat-Docker intricacies last year&mdash;has <a href="http://blog.oddbit.com/2014/12/22/accessing-the-serial-console-of-your-nova-servers/">a nice post on the new serial console support in OpenStack Juno</a>. Lars also has an outstanding post on <a href="http://blog.oddbit.com/2015/01/17/running-novalibvirt-and-novadocker-on-the-same-host/">running nova-libvirt and nova-docker on the same host</a>; very useful!</li>
<li>While heavily IBM-focused (perfectly understandable, since he works for IBM), <a href="https://cloudleader.wordpress.com/2015/01/11/docker-bluemix-and-the-ibm-container-service/">this post</a> by Ronan Dalton shows how to use Docker, Bluemix, and the IBM Containers service together.</li>
<li>I thought I had referenced this article before, but apparently I haven&rsquo;t. If you&rsquo;re looking for a good treatise on the topic of service discovery, Jason Wilder has written <a href="http://jasonwilder.com/blog/2014/02/04/service-discovery-in-the-cloud/">an excellent article</a> that provides a wealth of good information. It&rsquo;s getting a bit dated for this fast-moving space, but the article is a worthwhile read nevertheless (in my opinion).</li>
<li>Want to run FreeBSD under OpenStack? Check <a href="http://pellaeon.github.io/bsd-cloudinit/">this out</a>.</li>
<li>If you need a greater level of tenant isolation than OpenStack provides by default, Walter Bentley (of Rackspace) has some <a href="http://www.hitchnyc.com/openstack-multi-tenant-isolation/">information on multi-tenant isolation</a> that might be useful.</li>
<li>Randy Bias recently put up a nice article on <a href="http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/openstack/vanilla-openstack-doesnt-exist-and-never-will/">how &ldquo;vanilla OpenStack&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t exist and probably never will</a>. I especially liked this quote: &ldquo;Yes, you should absolutely push to have as much open source in your OpenStack deployment as possible, but since 100% isn’t possible, what [you] should be evaluating is what combination of open source and proprietary get you to the place where you can solve the business problem you are trying to conquer.&rdquo; (correction mine) This is a key point, in my opinion&mdash;as IT pros, we exist to help the business succeed. Yes, it&rsquo;s OK to have some principles (&ldquo;I want as much open source as possible&rdquo;), but you can&rsquo;t let that ideology get in the way of helping the business succeed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="operating-systemsapplications">Operating Systems/Applications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unless you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock, no doubt you&rsquo;ve heard about <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">ECS (Amazon EC2 Container Service)</a>. In the event you&rsquo;d like to use CoreOS with ECS, <a href="https://coreos.com/docs/running-coreos/cloud-providers/ecs/">here are the instructions</a> (accomplished easily via cloud-init).</li>
<li>Although specific to Consul, <a href="http://progrium.com/blog/2014/08/20/consul-service-discovery-with-docker/">this article</a> still provides some great information around &ldquo;config stores&rdquo; (distributed key/value stores) and using a distributed key/value store for service discovery in Docker environments.</li>
<li>Cody Bunch has a quick write-up on <a href="http://blog.codybunch.com/posts/2015-01-09-Basic-Server-Hardening-with-Salt/">using Salt for basic server hardening</a>. The post is useful, but&mdash;by deliberate choice on Cody&rsquo;s part&mdash;it&rsquo;s pretty high-level and basic. It would be great to see a more in-depth treatment of Salt by someone with great writing skills like Cody. Maybe a &ldquo;Salt for Puppet Users&rdquo; series?</li>
<li>The discussion around the &ldquo;best&rdquo; way to use Docker containers&mdash;as single-process containers or as multi-process containers&mdash;continues in a two-part blog series by Phusion. Part 1 describes what is known as <a href="http://blog.phusion.nl/2015/01/20/docker-and-the-pid-1-zombie-reaping-problem/">the PID 1 zombie reaping problem</a>, and part 2 discusses <a href="http://blog.phusion.nl/2015/01/20/baseimage-docker-fat-containers-treating-containers-vms/">the use of Baseimage-docker</a> as an example base image for Docker containers that provides a solution for the PID 1 zombie reaping problem (among other problems).</li>
<li>I know that it is heresy to speak out against Docker, but sometimes it really feels like using Docker makes things more complicated than they need to be. This article on <a href="http://jpetazzo.github.io/2015/01/19/dockerfile-and-data-in-volumes/">putting data in a volume in a Dockerfile</a> is one example.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jason Boche has <a href="http://www.boche.net/blog/index.php/2014/12/29/a-common-npiv-problem-with-a-solution/">a nice write-up</a> on how a QLogic HBA setting prevented NPIV from working in a Dell Compellent environment (used with VMware vSphere). While NPIV remains a &ldquo;niche&rdquo; technology that hasn&rsquo;t seen broad adoption, people are still out there using it (or trying), and Jason&rsquo;s post will be helpful in those cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="virtualization">Virtualization</h2>
<ul>
<li>The big VMware launch event was on February 2, and among the announcements was vSphere 6.0. There are <em>way</em> too many blogs out there to list all of them, so I&rsquo;ll just mention a few here. Eric Shanks has <a href="http://theithollow.com/2015/02/vsphere-6-0-announced/">a &ldquo;speeds and feeds&rdquo; post</a> on vSphere 6.0, and Julian Wood has <a href="http://www.wooditwork.com/2015/02/02/whats-new-vsphere-6-0-introduction/">a whole set of posts</a> on the new version. So, too, does <a href="http://wahlnetwork.com/category/deep-dives/vsphere-6-0-zomg/">Chris Wahl</a> (I could&rsquo;ve done without the &ldquo;ZOMG&rdquo; reference, but different strokes for different folks, right?) as well as <a href="http://www.ntpro.nl/blog/categories/48-vSphere-6">Eric Sloof</a>. There are many, <em>many</em> more posts out there, so if I didn&rsquo;t explicitly mention you I&rsquo;m sorry. Lots of great content happening!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="careersoft-skills">Career/Soft Skills</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m adding this section this time around because I have a couple of articles I wanted to share, but I don&rsquo;t know if it will become a regular part of TST or not. (Feedback is welcome; feel free to drop me an e-mail.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Iwan Rahabok, a colleague of mine at VMware based in Singapore, recently posted an article on <a href="http://virtual-red-dot.info/rise-sddc-architect/">the rise of the SDDC architect</a>. He postulates that, as more and more aspects of the data center fall under virtualization (network virtualization, storage virtualization, etc.) that there is a need for someone to be the SDDC architect, to lead up the broad design across the entirety of the software-defined data center. I don&rsquo;t necessarily disagree, though I do think it might take longer for us to get there than perhaps it should. (Oh, and if you&rsquo;re looking for a good book on vRealize Operations, <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/vmware-vrealize-operations-performance-and-capacity-management">look no further</a>.)</li>
<li>Via Maish Saidel-Keesing, I saw this article about <a href="http://watirmelon.com/2015/02/03/never-compare-your-organizations-insides-with-another-organizations-outsides/">comparing your organization&rsquo;s inside with another organization&rsquo;s outsides</a>. Great article, and definitely something to keep in mind. The grass isn&rsquo;t always greener on the other side.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to wrap up now; this post is already longer than it probably should be. Here&rsquo;s hoping you found something useful! Although I haven&rsquo;t (yet) enabled comments on the new site, you&rsquo;re always welcome to drop me an e-mail or hit me up on Twitter with any feedback you might have.</p>
