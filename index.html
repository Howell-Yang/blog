      <span class="post-date">279 May 272727</span>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve recently started migrating many of the applications on my <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a> 36 laptop to their <a href="https://www.flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a> versions. For the most part, this has been pretty straightforward, although there isn&rsquo;t really any method for migrating configuration and data. Today I ran into a problem with <a href="https://meldmerge.org/">Meld</a>, a graphical diff utility, and using it with the <code>git difftool</code> command. Below I&rsquo;ll share how I worked around this problem.</p>
<p>Normally, the integration between Git and Meld&mdash;which is what enables you to run <code>git difftool</code> and have the results show up in Meld&mdash;would look something like this (this is from <code>~/.gitconfig</code>):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml"><span style="display:flex;"><span>[<span style="color:#a6e22e">merge</span>]

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, when Meld is installed as a Flatpak, <code>/usr/bin/meld</code> doesn&rsquo;t exist. In order to continue using Meld with the <code>git difftool</code> command, you must change the Git configuration to look like this instead:</p>

      <span class="post-date">279 May 272727</span>
      <p>Welcome to Technology Short Take #155, just in time for the 2022 Memorial Day holiday weekend! (Here in the US, at least.) I mean, don&rsquo;t you want to spend this weekend catching up on some technology-related articles instead of cooking on the grill and gathering with friends and family? I certainly hope not! Still, for those who need a little technology fix over the weekend, hopefully I&rsquo;ve included something useful in the list of articles below. Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="networking">Networking</h2>
<ul>
<li>Isovalent&mdash;the company behind the Cilium project&mdash;has been talking a lot about how the use of eBPF will transform things, including the architecture of a service mesh. Along those lines, one of their latest articles discusses <a href="https://isovalent.com/blog/post/2022-05-03-servicemesh-security">how to achieve identity-based mutual authentication leveraging eBPF</a>. If I&rsquo;m understanding the article correctly (and feel free to correct me if I am mistaken) it looks as if Cilium Service Mesh will leverage/does leverage a combination of certificate-based mTLS for identity at the workload level and node-based transport encryption (via WireGuard) for data confidentiality. Even though I know that the underlying mechanisms are different, subjectively this <em>feels</em> a lot like using tunnels to connect workloads on different compute nodes (i.e., network virtualization). Is the relationship between network virtualization and service mesh closer than some folks might wish to admit?</li>

      <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://www.howellyang.com/2022/05/12/fine-tuning-control-plane-access-with-cluster-api/">Fine-Tuning Control Plane Access with Cluster API</a></h1>
      <span class="post-date">129 May 121212</span>
      <p>When <a href="https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io">Cluster API</a> creates a workload cluster, it also creates a load balancing solution to handle traffic to the workload cluster&rsquo;s control plane. This is necessary so that the control plane endpoint is decoupled from the underlying control plane nodes (which facilitates scaling the control plane, among other things). On AWS, this mean creating an ELB and a set of security groups. For flexibility, Cluster API provides a limited ability to customize this control plane load balancer. In this post, I&rsquo;ll show you how to use this functionality to fine-tune access to a workload cluster&rsquo;s control plane when using Cluster API with AWS.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Cluster API (hereafter just referred to as &ldquo;CAPI&rdquo;), then <a href="/2019/08/26/an-introduction-to-kubernetes-cluster-api/">my introduction to CAPI article</a> may be useful. Keep in mind that article was written in 2019, while the project was still in its early stages. The high-level concepts are correct, but some of the details may have shifted slightly over the last three years as the project progressed from <code>v1alpha1</code> APIs to the now-current <code>v1beta1</code> APIs.</p>
<p>The key here is the <code>controlPlaneLoadBalancer</code> object, which is part of the <code>AWSCluster</code> object (see details <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws/blob/master/api/v1beta1/awscluster_types.go#L55-L57">here in the code</a> or <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api-provider-aws/api/v1beta1#AWSClusterSpec">here via <code>pkg.go.dev</code></a>). With regard to access to a workload cluster&rsquo;s control plane via its control plane load balancer, two fields are of particular interest:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>additionalSecurityGroups</code> field allows you to list any additional security groups&mdash;referenced by security group ID&mdash;that the control plane load balancer should use (this is in addition to the standard set of security groups created by CAPI). This is an optional field.</li>
<li>The <code>scheme</code> field allows you to specify whether the load balancer should be externally-accessible from the Internet (specified with the value &ldquo;internet-facing&rdquo;, which is the default value) or not (specified with the value &ldquo;internal&rdquo;). If you specify &ldquo;internal&rdquo; as the scheme, then the load balancer won&rsquo;t get a public IP address and won&rsquo;t be reachable via the Internet. This would be a great way to restrict access to only those connections coming via a VPN (or similar) into the VPC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally, I would <em>at least</em> switch the scheme on the control plane load balancer; otherwise, the API server of your newly-created workload cluster is publicly accessible via the Internet. You can then leverage any additional security groups as needed.</p>
<p>One note to keep in mind: the default security group created by the AWS provider for CAPI (referred to as CAPA) allows access from <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> to the control plane load balancer. If you need to <em>restrict</em> access to something more fine-grained than that, using the <code>additionalSecurityGroups</code> field is not the way. As outlined <a href="https://cluster-api-aws.sigs.k8s.io/topics/bring-your-own-aws-infrastructure.html#security-groups">here</a>, you&rsquo;ll instead want to use the <code>securityGroupOverrides</code> field (which is found at <code>spec.network.securityGroupOverrides</code>).</p>
<p>I hope this information is useful. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions (or corrections, in the event I explained/presented something incorrectly). You can find me on <a href="https://kubernetes.slack.com">the Kubernetes Slack</a> (as well as a number of other Slack communities) as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lowe">on Twitter</a>.</p>

      <p>Welcome to Technology Short Take #153! My personal and professional life has kept me busy over the last couple of months, so things have been quiet here on the blog. I&rsquo;ve still been collecting links to share with you, though, and here&rsquo;s the latest collection. I hope you&rsquo;re able to find something useful here!</p>
<h2 id="networking">Networking</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pansift.com/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/">This article</a> contains some good information on IPv6 for those who are just starting to get more familiar with it, although toward the end it turns into a bit of an advertisement.</li>

Arthur Chiao&rsquo;s <a href="https://arthurchiao.art/blog/cracking-k8s-node-proxy/">post on cracking <code>kube-proxy</code></a> is also an excellent resource&mdash;in fact, there&rsquo;s so much information packed in there you may need to read it more than once.</li>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>Although Linux is often considered to be superior to Windows and macOS with regard to security, it is not without <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/linux-has-been-bitten-by-its-most-high-severity-vulnerability-in-years/">its own security flaws</a>. I, personally, would posit that Linux <em>can</em> be more secure than other platforms, but it requires proper configuration and can still be undone by a loose nut behind the keyboard.</li>
<li>Ouch&mdash;<a href="https://orca.security/resources/blog/autowarp-microsoft-azure-automation-service-vulnerability/">another Azure vulnerability</a> that allows cross-account access.</li>

<li>Diego Sucaria shows <a href="https://diegosucaria.info/how-to-access-a-private-eks-cluster-from-your-local-machine-without-a-vpn/">how to use an SSH SOCKS proxy to access private Kubernetes clusters</a>. This is an interesting approach that, honestly, I hadn&rsquo;t considered. (Warning: I&rsquo;m not sure the configuration as described in the article will actually work, but the concept is sound.) If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with SSH SOCKS proxying, read <a href="https://linuxtect.com/create-socks-proxy-via-ssh-tunnelling/">this</a> to get up to speed (or use your favorite web search engine, there are many articles out there on this topic).</li>
<li>Version 3.8.0 of Helm adds the ability to store and work with charts in container (OCI, Open Container Initiative) registries (instead of Helm repositories). More information is available in <a href="https://helm.sh/blog/storing-charts-in-oci/">this Helm blog post</a>.</li>

<li>I found this article to be <a href="https://www.fermyon.com/blog/how-to-think-about-wasm">a good overview of WebAssembly</a>.</li>
<li>Matt Oswalt takes readers though <a href="https://oswalt.dev/2022/02/non-local-address-binds-in-linux/">a fairly in-depth look</a> at sockets and address binds in Linux.</li>
<li>If you are an absolute beginner with Envoy Proxy, <a href="https://adamtheautomator.com/envoy-proxy/">this tutorial</a> will help you get started. However, it quickly runs out of steam, and you&rsquo;ll need to progress to more advanced examples and documentation to continue your learning journey.</li>
<li>I asked a question about Git, Git tags, and releasing versions of a project on Twitter the other day (here&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lowe/status/1513557942255206401">the tweet</a>), and <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">this article on Git branching</a> was shared with me. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll find it useful as well!</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been digging into OIDC/OAuth 2.0 lately, and learning about JWTs (JSON Web Tokens, see <a href="https://jwt.io/introduction/">here</a> for an introduction). I found this article telling folks to <a href="https://sdoxsee.github.io/blog/2020/01/06/stop-overloading-jwts-with-permission-claims">stop overloading JWTs with permissions claims</a> a while ago, but at the time I didn&rsquo;t fully understand all the concepts or the implications. Now that I&rsquo;ve had some time and some exposure, this makes a lot more sense to me&mdash;and I agree with the author!</li>
<li>Speaking of JWTs: they don&rsquo;t score so well in Thomas Ptacek&rsquo;s <a href="https://fly.io/blog/api-tokens-a-tedious-survey/">survey of API tokens</a>. There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack in Ptacek&rsquo;s article; I suspect I&rsquo;ll be coming back to read it again later as my knowledge in this area grows. Some of it is still too advanced for me right now.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<p>Nothing here this time around&mdash;maybe <a href="https://jmetz.com/2022/03/storage-short-take-41/">go check J Metz&rsquo; blog instead</a>?</p>
<h2 id="virtualization">Virtualization</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re a PowerCLI user, <a href="https://www.hollebollevsan.nl/usefull-powercli-scripts/">here are some scripts you may find useful</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vmwareopsguide.com/">This</a> is such an invaluable resource. And it&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/TheNewStellW/vmware-operations-guide">publicly available on GitHub</a>, although not licensed with a typical open source license.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="careersoft-skills">Career/Soft Skills</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever had one of those days where you just aren&rsquo;t feeling like working? I think we all have. Here is <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/11/how-to-keep-working-when-youre-just-not-feeling-it">an article from the Harvard Business Review</a> on some strategies for motivating yourself when that happens.</li>
<li>Although written from the perspective of a developer seeking to improve their knowledge in a particular programming language, I think the ideas and principles laid out in this article on <a href="https://www.learncoderetain.com/2021/06/28/how-developers-remember-things/">how developers remember things</a> are applicable to folks learning new things in other IT disciplines as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this time around. I&rsquo;ll be back soon with more original content as well as more Short Takes! In the meantime, feel free to reach out to me&mdash;my e-mail address isn&rsquo;t hard to find, I&rsquo;m present in a number of Slack communities, and you can always hit <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lowe">me on Twitter</a> (DMs are open).

      <p>Welcome to Technology Short Take #152! Normally I&rsquo;d publish a Technology Short Take in the morning on a Friday, but I really wanted to get this one out so I&rsquo;m making it live late in the day on a Monday.

      <span class="post-date">179 May 171717</span>
      <p>When configuring mutual TLS (mTLS) on <a href="https://kuma.io/">the open source Kuma service mesh</a>, users have a couple of different options. They can use a &ldquo;builtin&rdquo; certificate authority (CA), in which Kuma itself will generate a CA certificate and key for use in creating service-specific mTLS certificates. Users also have the option of using a &ldquo;provided&rdquo; CA, in which they must supply a CA certificate and key for Kuma to use when creating service-specific mTLS certificates. Both of these options are described <a href="https://kuma.io/docs/1.4.x/policies/mutual-tls/">on this page in the Kuma documentation</a>. In this post, I&rsquo;d like to explore the use of <a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager</a> as a &ldquo;provided&rdquo; CA for mTLS on Kuma.</p><em><a href="https://www.howellyang.com/2022/02/17/using-cert-manager-with-kuma-mtls/">Read more...</a></em>

      <span class="post-date">219 May 212121</span>
      <p>Seven years ago, I wrote a quick post on <a href="/2015/05/26/bootstrap-servers-ansible/">bootstrapping servers into Ansible</a>. The basic gist of the post was that you can use variables on the <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> command-line to specify hosts that aren&rsquo;t part of your inventory or log in via a different user (useful if the host doesn&rsquo;t yet have a dedicated Ansible user account because you want to use Ansible to create that account). Recently, though, I encountered a situation where this approach doesn&rsquo;t work, and in this post I&rsquo;ll describe the workaround.</p><em><a href="https://www.howellyang.com/2022/01/21/follow-up-bootstrapping-servers-ansible/">Read more...</a></em>

      <p>Welcome to Technology Short Take #151, the first Technology Short Take of 2022. I hope everyone had a great holiday season and that 2022 is off to a wonderful start! I have a few more links than normal this time around, although I didn&rsquo;t find articles in a couple categories.

      <p>It seems there are lots of tutorials on setting up a PKI (public key infrastructure) using <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">HashiCorp Vault</a>. What I&rsquo;ve found missing from most of these tutorials, however, is how to get details on certificates issued by a Vault-driven PKI <em>after</em> the initial creation. For example, someone other than you issued a certificate, but now you need to get the details for said certificate. How is that done? In this post, I&rsquo;ll show you a couple ways to get details on certificates issued and stored in HashiCorp Vault.</p><em><a href="https://www.howellyang.com/2022/01/12/getting-certificate-details-from-hashicorp-vault/">Read more...</a></em>

      <p>I am by no means a developer (not by a long shot!), but I have been learning lots of development-related things over the last several years and trying to incorporate those into my workflows. One of these is the idea of <em>test-driven development</em> (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Wikipedia</a> for a definition and some additional information), in which one writes tests to validate functionality before writing the code to implement said functionality (pardon the paraphrasing). In this post, I&rsquo;ll discuss how to use <a href="https://www.conftest.dev/"><code>conftest</code></a> to (loosely) implement test-driven development for <a href="https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/kustomize/">Kustomize</a> overlays.</p><em><a href="https://www.howellyang.com/2022/01/10/using-test-driven-development-for-kustomize-overlays/">Read more...</a></em>

      <p>About six months ago I purchased an <a href="https://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbolt-3-dock-14-port">OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock</a> to replace my <a href="https://www.anker.com/a8396launch">Anker PowerElite Thunderbolt 3 Dock</a> (see my review <a href="/2020/07/24/review-anker-powerexpand-elite-thunderbolt-3-dock/">here</a>). While there was nothing necessarily wrong with the Anker PowerElite, it lacked a digital audio port that I could use to send audio to a soundbar positioned under my monitor. (I&rsquo;d grown accustomed to using a soundbar when my 2012 Mac Pro was my primary workstation.) In this post, I&rsquo;ll provide a brief review of the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock.</p><em><a href="https://www.howellyang.com/2021/12/23/review-owc-thunderbolt-dock/">Read more...</a></em>

For all the time I&rsquo;ve been using this approach, I&rsquo;ve also been unhappy with the overlay-based approach that had evolved as a way of managing multiple workload clusters. With the recent release of CAPI 1.0 and the v1beta1 API, I took this opportunity to see if there was a better way. I found a different way&mdash;time will tell if it is a better way. In this post, I&rsquo;ll share how I&rsquo;m using Kustomize components to help streamline managing multiple CAPI workload clusters.</p><em><a href="https://www.howellyang.com/2021/11/01/using-kustomize-components-with-cluster-api/">Read more...</a></em>

      <p>Welcome to Technology Short Take #147! The list of articles is a bit shorter than usual this time around, but I&rsquo;ve still got a good collection of articles and posts covering topics in networking, hardware (mostly focused on Apple&rsquo;s processors), cloud computing, and virtualization. There&rsquo;s bound to be something in here for most everyone! (At least, I hope so.) Enjoy your weekend reading!</p><em><a href="https://www.howellyang.com/2021/10/29/technology-short-take-147/">Read more...</a></em>

      <span class="post-date">259 May 252525</span>
      <p>The <a href="https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/">Kubernetes Cluster API (CAPI) project</a>&mdash;which recently released v1.0&mdash;can, if you wish, help manage the underlying infrastructure associated with a cluster. (You&rsquo;re also fully able to have CAPI <a href="https://cluster-api-aws.sigs.k8s.io/topics/consuming-existing-aws-infrastructure.html">use existing infrastructure</a> as well.) Speaking specifically of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, this means that the <a href="https://cluster-api-aws.sigs.k8s.io/">Cluster API Provider for AWS</a> is able to manage VPCs, subnets, routes and route tables, gateways, and&mdash;of course&mdash;EC2 instances. These EC2 instances are booted from a set of AMIs (Amazon Machine Images, definitely pronounced &ldquo;ay-em-eye&rdquo; with <a href="https://blog.technodrone.cloud/2019/03/ami-has-3-syllables-ami-aws.html">three syllables</a>) that are prepared and maintained by the CAPI project. In this short and simple post, I&rsquo;ll show you how to influence the AMI selection process that CAPI&rsquo;s AWS provider uses.</p><em><a href="https://www.howellyang.com/2021/10/25/influencing-cluster-api-ami-selection/">Read more...</a></em>

      <span class="post-date">219 May 212121</span>
      <p>Using CLI tools&mdash;instead of a &ldquo;wall of YAML&rdquo;&mdash;to install things onto <a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a> is a growing trend, it seems. <a href="https://istio.io">Istio</a> and <a href="https://cilium.io">Cilium</a>, for example, each have a CLI tool for installing their respective project. I get the reasons why; you can build logic into a CLI tool that you can&rsquo;t build into a YAML file. <a href="https://kuma.io">Kuma</a>, the open source service mesh maintained largely by Kong and a CNCF Sandbox project, takes a similar approach with its <code>kumactl</code> tool. In this post, however, I&rsquo;d like to take a look at creating reusable YAML to install Kuma, instead of using the CLI tool every time you install.</p><em><a href="https://www.howellyang.com/2021/10/21/creating-reusable-kuma-installation-yaml/">Read more...</a></em>

      <span class="post-date">129 May 121212</span>
      <p>In 2018, after finding a dearth of information on setting up <a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a> with AWS integration/support, I set out to try to establish some level of documentation on this topic. That effort resulted in a few different blog posts, but ultimately culminated in <a href="/2019/08/14/setting-up-aws-integrated-kubernetes-115-cluster-kubeadm/">this post on setting up an AWS-integrated Kubernetes cluster using <code>kubeadm</code></a>. Although originally written for Kubernetes 1.15, the process described in that post is still accurate for newer versions of Kubernetes. With the release of Kubernetes 1.22, though, the in-tree AWS cloud provider&mdash;which is what is used/described in the post linked above&mdash;has been deprecated in favor of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-aws">the external cloud provider</a>. In this post, I&rsquo;ll show how to set up an AWS-integrated Kubernetes cluster using the external AWS cloud provider.</p><em><a href="https://www.howellyang.com/2021/10/12/using-the-external-aws-cloud-provider-for-kubernetes/">Read more...</a></em>
