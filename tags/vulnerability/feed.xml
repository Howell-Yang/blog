      <description>And here I thought things would settle down a bit now that Microsoft has released MS06-001, the patch for the previous exploitable WMF flaw. Now, just days after the release of that out-of-band security patch, more WMF flaws have been uncovered.
This article describes some new WMF flaws recently uncovered and announced on the BugTraq mailing list. (See this article for more information as well.) Apparently, Symantec issued a warning via its Deepsight Management System, but I was unable to find an available online copy of that advisory.</description>
