      <description>This is a very short blog post. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s probably less of a blog post and more of just a question:
Have you registered for Spousetivities at EMC World 2011 yet?
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet, I encourage you to surf over to the registration page and sign up now!
For more information on some of the planned activities, have a look at Crystal&amp;rsquo;s Spousetivities post here.</description>

      <description>Heading to EMC World 2011 in Las Vegas in May? Cool, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably see you there. What&amp;rsquo;s even cooler, though, is the fact that my wife, Crystal (@crystal_lowe on Twitter) will be, for the first time, organizing spouse activities for EMC World!
If you&amp;rsquo;re a regular reader of my site you know that Crystal first launched spouse activities at VMworld 2008 in Las Vegas, and since that time her spouse activities&amp;mdash;now known as &amp;ldquo;Spousetivities&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;have become enormously popular.</description>
