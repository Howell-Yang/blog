      <description>&lt;p&gt;In late September, I was given a CPLAY2air wireless CarPlay adapter as a gift. Neither of my vehicles support wireless CarPlay, and so I was looking forward to using the CPLAY2air device to enable the use of CarPlay without having to have my phone plugged into a cable. Here&amp;rsquo;s my feedback on the CPLAY2air device after about six weeks of use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I Might Leave OS X</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Mac OS X user for a long time; I switched from Windows to OS X in 2003 when the OS X flavor of the day was 10.2 &amp;ldquo;Jaguar.&amp;rdquo; Since that time, I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded hardware (moving from a Titanium PowerBook G4 to a Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro circa 2006, then to a 2009-era 15&amp;quot; Core 2 Duo-based MacBookPro, and finally to a 13&amp;quot; MacBook Pro with a Core i7) and I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded OS X releases (from Jaguar to Panther to Tiger to Leopard and finally to Snow Leopard).</description>

      <title>A Month with Localscope</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2011/05/02/a-month-with-localscope/</link>

      <description>For the last month or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using an iPhone app called Localscope when I travel. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty handy little app, designed to integrate with various online services such as Google, Twitter, Bing, and Foursquare, that leverages the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s GPS functionality and built-in compass to help you find local places of interest: restaurants, coffee shops, ice cream, etc.
Basically, the app works like this: you select what you&amp;rsquo;re looking to find&amp;mdash;restaurant, cafe, bank, gas station, or even a custom search like &amp;ldquo;Starbucks&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;and then Localscope goes out and gets that information from the selected online source (there&amp;rsquo;s a slider at the bottom where you choose the online source).</description>

      <description>For a couple of different reasons&amp;mdash;one of them being a desire to have Google Voice take over voicemail responsibilities&amp;mdash;I needed to find a way to make my iPhone wait longer before sending an unanswered call to voicemail. As it turns out, this thread has the answer I needed. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works. (Note: Do this at your own risk. I&amp;rsquo;m not responsible for any problems you might create as a result of this information.</description>

      <description>Quickly following the initial beta release of Virtualization Manager Mobile (VMM), Schley Andrew Kutz has now released beta 1.5 of VMM. The updated beta, available via the relaunched lostcreations.com site, boasts several new features:
  In addition to support for VMware Infrastructure 3 and VMware Server 2, VMM now supports Citrix XenServer 5.
  VMM will now &amp;ldquo;gracefully degrade&amp;rdquo; on mobile devices that don&amp;rsquo;t have a fully AJAX-capable browser.</description>

      <title>Configuring Mail.app and iPhone with Google IMAP</title>

      <description>So I recently moved almost all of my personal e-mail domains over to Google Apps. A couple of people have asked, &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo; My answer is simple: it&amp;rsquo;s easier. The e-mail functionality of my current hosting provider is lacking in a couple of key areas:
  Rather than using the emerging standard of having e-mail clients connect to TCP port 587 (Submission) to send e-mail, they used a very non-standard practice of using TCP port 26.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at iCal, CalDAV, Google Calendar, and the iPhone</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2008/12/23/a-closer-look-at-ical-caldav-google-calendar-and-the-iphone/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2008/12/23/a-closer-look-at-ical-caldav-google-calendar-and-the-iphone/</guid>
      <description>A few weeks ago I posted an article titled Manually Configuring iCal for Google Calendar and CalDAV, in which I provided a way to configure iCal in Leopard to use CalDAV to communicate with Google Calendar. I&amp;rsquo;d done this once before, but when Google made the CalDAV support &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; they removed the how-to pages and instead pointed everyone to their application to do it automatically. In any case, a bit of experimentation turned up the right settings, so in the event you&amp;rsquo;re interested, have a look there.</description>

      <title>iPhone Irony</title>

      <description>Does anyone else find it a bit ironic that neither AT&amp;amp;T nor Apple have iPhone-optimized versions of their web sites? Or am I the only one wondering why the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s exclusive suppliers don&amp;rsquo;t optimize their own sites for the iPhone?</description>

      <title>OmniGraffle and OmniFocus Updates</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2008/11/20/omnigraffle-and-omnifocus-updates/</link>

      <description>Two of my most-used applications have been updated to new versions. OmniGraffle is now updated to version 5.1, and OmniFocus is now updated to version 1.5. (Funny, I just noticed how the versions numbers are reversed&amp;ndash;5.1 and 1.5.)
The OmniGraffle update brings one feature that I have especially been anticipating: the ability to import Windows Metafile images in Visio diagrams. This extremely useful feature, first hinted at here back in March, will tremendously ease Visio compatibility and should open up lots of Visio shapes to be used in OmniGraffle that previously were not usable.</description>

      <title>The Adventures of OmniFocus Bonjour Sync</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made no secret of the fact that I use and enjoy OmniFocus, a GTD application from the fine folks at OmniGroup. (Just for the record, I also use and enjoy OmniGraffle and OmniOutliner. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t that qualify me for a free license to OmniPlan?) In fact, one of the driving factors for purchasing my iPhone&amp;mdash;aside from the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s cool and I wanted one&amp;mdash;was the fact that OmniGroup also had an iPhone version of OmniFocus.</description>

      <description>For those that follow me on Twitter, you may have noticed that I purchased and installed OmniFocus for iPhone over the weekend. If you are a GTD lover and a Mac user, you are no doubt familiar with the &amp;ldquo;regular&amp;rdquo; OmniFocus application from The Omni Group. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using OmniFocus for quite some time now (I wrote about that back in February), and I was really excited about the possibility of taking it mobile with me on my iPhone.</description>

      <title>Any iPhone App Recommendations?</title>

      <description>Yesterday I bought my iPhone 3G. When the original iPhone was released, I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy one because it lacked 3G network connectivity, and the Samsung BlackJack 2 I was using was already 3G capable. In addition, the BlackJack supported ActiveSync for connectivity to my corporate Exchange infrastructure, and the iPhone didn&amp;rsquo;t. After the iPhone 3G was released, my two primary complaints had now been removed, and I said that I would get one&amp;mdash;but not right away.</description>

      <title>ActiveSync on the iPhone</title>

      <description>Apple has just given me one more reason to possibly switch to an iPhone&amp;hellip;
iPhone opens to Exchange e-mail
I&amp;rsquo;m currently using a Samsung BlackJack II, a Windows Mobile 6-based device with 3G connectivity. The e-mail functionality is great, but not having an easy way to keep my Address Book contacts in sync with my phone is a major hassle. It looks like using an iPhone would help address that.</description>

      <title>Apple and VMware...or Xen?</title>

      <description>For a company that wants their virtualization technology to be ubiquitous, it would seem to make sense that VMware needs it to run on every major host operating system. Right now, VMware has Windows and Linux covered. But what about OS X? There is a tremendous amount of attention being paid to OS X right now, from many different sides, and Apple seems to be pushing OS X in a number of different directions (such as using OS X as the basis for the iPhone, and rumors of future OS X-based iPods circulating).</description>
