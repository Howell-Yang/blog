      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #135! This will likely be the last Technology Short Take of 2020, so it&amp;rsquo;s a tad longer than usual. Sorry about that! You know me&amp;mdash;I just want to make sure everyone has plenty of technical content to read during the holidays. And speaking of holidays&amp;hellip;whatever holidays you do (or don&amp;rsquo;t) celebrate, I hope that the rest of the year is a good one for you. Now, on to the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #116! This one is a bit shorter than usual, due to holidays in the US and my life being busy. Nevertheless, I hope that I managed to capture something you find useful or helpful. As always, your feedback is welcome, so if you have suggestions, corrections, or comments, you&amp;rsquo;re welcome to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/scott_lowe&#34;&gt;contact me via Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Welcome to Technology Short Take #75, the final Technology Short Take for 2016. Fortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s not the final Technology Short Take ever, as I&amp;rsquo;ll be back in 2017 with more content. Until then, here&amp;rsquo;s some data center-related articles and links for your enjoyment.
Networking  Ajay Chenampara has some observations about running Ansible at scale against network devices. Andrey Khomyakov shares some information on automating the setup of whitebox switches running Cumulus Linux in part 2 of this series on learning network automation.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Technology Short Take #43, another episode in my irregularly-published series of articles, links, and thoughts from around the web, focusing on data center technologies like networking, virtualization, storage, and cloud computing. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping you find something useful.
Networking   Jason Edelman recently took a look at Docker networking. While Docker is receiving a great deal of attention, I have to say that I feel Docker networking is a key area that hasn&amp;rsquo;t received the amount of attention that it probably needs.</description>

      <title>Using pf on OS X Mountain Lion</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about adding an extra layer of network security to your Macintosh by leveraging the BSD-level ipfw firewall, in addition to the standard GUI firewall and additional third-party firewalls (like Little Snitch). In OS X Lion and OS X Mountain Lion, though, ipfw was deprecated in favor of pf, the powerful packet filter that I believe originated on OpenBSD. (OS X&amp;rsquo;s version of pf is ported from FreeBSD.) In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how to use pf on OS X.</description>

      <description>As you might have noticed in recent blog posts, I&amp;rsquo;m spending a fair amount of time working with open source solutions like Ubuntu Linux, OpenBSD, Puppet, and similar. As part of the effort to make myself more familiar with these and other open source projects, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to re-architect my home network using predominantly open source software.
Here are the open source software projects that I know for sure I&amp;rsquo;ll end up using:</description>

      <title>Getting Hiera Working</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2012/07/24/getting-hiera-working/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2012/07/24/getting-hiera-working/</guid>
      <description>As I mentioned in a previous post, the next iteration of my Puppet explorations involves the use of Hiera. Hiera, a project also managed by Puppet Labs, is described as &amp;ldquo;a simple pluggable hierarchical database.&amp;rdquo; In the Puppet world, what that means is we can use Hiera to store data values outside of the manifests, then look them up dynamically as the configurations are being compiled and applied to the nodes.</description>

      <title>Updated Multi-OS Puppet Configuration</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2012/07/09/updated-multi-os-puppet-configuration/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2012/07/09/updated-multi-os-puppet-configuration/</guid>
      <description>I received some great feedback on my post about using Puppet with multiple operating systems. One of the suggestions was to do a better job of following the &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; Puppet style guide for syntax and file layout. With that in mind, I installed puppet-lint on my Puppet master server using apt-get install rubygems followed by gem install puppet-lint.
Using puppet-lint, I was able to correct all &amp;ldquo;errors&amp;rdquo; in the manifest, but was left with one warning regarding line length.</description>

      <description>Over the last few days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with the open source edition of Puppet, the configuration management/automation tool. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned quite a bit, but I still have a long, long way to go. What I wanted to share in this post is what I learned in using Puppet with clients using different operating systems (OSes). If you are a Puppet expert, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear any tips and tricks you might have to help me improve.</description>

      <title>Setting Up ipfw on Mac OS X</title>

      <description>Using multiple layers of security has long been recognized as a useful strategy in hardening your computers against attack or exploit. In this post, I want to explain how to set up and configure the BSD-level ipfw firewall that is present in Mac OS X. While ipfw is certainly not a security panacea, it can be a solid part of a broader security strategy.
Setting up ipfw on Mac OS X has three basic steps:</description>

      <title>Allegations Regarding FBI Involvement with OpenBSD</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get right to the point and set the record straight: I am not, nor have I ever been, affiliated with or employed by the FBI or any other government agency.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I was surprised when word surfaced that I had been implicated in some sort of conspiracy regarding a plan to place secret backdoors into an OpenBSD cryptographic framework, and that my recent advocacy of OpenBSD was based on my alleged involvement with the FBI.</description>

      <description>This is one of those posts that is as much for my own benefit as it is for others. For a few weeks now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a dynamic DNS setup for my home/home office network involving BIND and the ISC DHCP daemon running on a pair of OpenBSD virtual machines. I finally got it to work (thanks in no small part to this article and this how-to post) and then found that I needed to make some manual edits to the DNS zones.</description>

      <description>If you were following my tweets over the last few days, you probably already know that I have been working on setting up a CCNA study environment using Ubuntu Linux, GNS3, and VMware Workstation. After a couple days of difficulties, I finally managed to make it work last night. Here are the steps that I took to make it work.
Before we start, there is the standard disclaimer: these are the steps that worked for me; these steps might or might not work for you, and are almost guaranteed not to work with different Linux distributions or different versions of the associated software.</description>

      <title>A Quick and Simple Guide to Building an OpenBSD VM</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll start this off with a disclaimer: this post is really more for my own benefit than the benefit of anyone else.
OpenBSD is my OS of choice when it comes to setting up a quick, simple UNIX-based virtual machine (VM). Need a virtual firewall? Use OpenBSD. Need a router? Use OpenBSD. Need a web server or an FTP server? Use OpenBSD. Need to run some network security tools? Use OpenBSD.</description>
