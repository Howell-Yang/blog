      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #150! This is the last Technology Short Take of 2021, so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll close the year out &amp;ldquo;with a bang&amp;rdquo; with this collection of links and articles on various technology areas. Bring on the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #148, aka the Thanksgiving Edition (at least, for US readers). I&amp;rsquo;ve been scouring RSS feeds and various social media sites, collecting as many useful links and articles as I can find: from networking hardware and networking CI/CD pipelines to Kernel TLS and tricks for improving your working memory. That&amp;rsquo;s quite the range! I hope that you find something useful here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #145! What will you find in this Tech Short Take? Well, let&amp;rsquo;s see&amp;hellip;stuff on Envoy, network automation, network designs, M1 chips (and potential open source variants!), a bevy of security articles (including a couple on very severe vulnerabilities), Kubernetes, AWS IAM, and so much more! I hope that you find something useful here. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I hope you find something useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #111!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #109! This is the first Technology Short Take of 2019. It may be confirmation bias, but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed of number of sites adding &amp;ldquo;Short Take&amp;rdquo;-type posts to their content lineup. I&amp;rsquo;ll take that as flattery, even if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily intended that way. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take 97! This Tech Short Take marks the end of an era (sort of); it&amp;rsquo;s the last Tech Short Take published while I&amp;rsquo;m a VMware employee (today is my last day; see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2018/03/26/time-to-evolve/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more details). But enough about me&amp;mdash;let&amp;rsquo;s talk some tech! This Short Take may be a bit longer than some, so buckle up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
