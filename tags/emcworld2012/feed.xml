      <description>This year at EMC World 2012 (being held once again in Las Vegas, NV), Spousetivities returns for their second year at EMC&amp;rsquo;s user conference. As usual, my wife Crystal&amp;mdash;who founded and runs Spousetivities&amp;mdash;has a great set of activities planned for any spouses, partners, family members, or friends that will be traveling with EMC World conference attendees. (EMC&amp;rsquo;ers: those of you attending the TC Conference can have your traveling companions attend Spousetivities too!</description>
