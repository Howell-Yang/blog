      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last three years, the site has been largely unchanged with regard to the structure and overall function even while I continue to work to provide quality technical content. However, time was beginning to take its toll, and some &amp;ldquo;under the hood&amp;rdquo; work was needed. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, I spent some time updating the site, and there are a few changes I wanted to mention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Website Features</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2017/08/10/information-recent-site-migration/&#34;&gt;migrated this site to Hugo&lt;/a&gt; a little over a month ago was that &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; offered the ability to do things with the site that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t (easily) do with Jekyll (via GitHub Pages). Over the last few days, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken advantage of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s flexibility to add a couple new features to the site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Brief Site Update</title>

      <description>As many of you may already know, GitHub recently upgraded GitHub Pages to use Jekyll 3.0, and along with that upgrade comes a few (relatively) minor changes to the site as a result. Here are the details of what&amp;rsquo;s changed here.
The most notable difference is a change in the site&amp;rsquo;s feed URL. Whereas the feed used to be available at http://blog.scottlowe.org/feed/, changes in how Jekyll 3.0 handles permalinks mean that URL is no longer sustainable.</description>
