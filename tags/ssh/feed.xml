      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #153! My personal and professional life has kept me busy over the last couple of months, so things have been quiet here on the blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve still been collecting links to share with you, though, and here&amp;rsquo;s the latest collection. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re able to find something useful here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #142! This time around, the Networking section is a bit light, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got plenty of cloud computing links and articles for you to enjoy, along with some stuff on OSes and applications, programming, and soft skills. Hopefully there&amp;rsquo;s something useful here for you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #136, the first Short Take of 2021! The content this time around seems to be a bit more security-focused, but I&amp;rsquo;ve still managed to include a few links in other areas. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping you find something useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #135! This will likely be the last Technology Short Take of 2020, so it&amp;rsquo;s a tad longer than usual. Sorry about that! You know me&amp;mdash;I just want to make sure everyone has plenty of technical content to read during the holidays. And speaking of holidays&amp;hellip;whatever holidays you do (or don&amp;rsquo;t) celebrate, I hope that the rest of the year is a good one for you. Now, on to the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #131! I&amp;rsquo;m back with another collection of articles on various data center technologies. This time around the content is a tad heavy on the security side, but I&amp;rsquo;ve still managed to pull in articles on networking, cloud computing, applications, and some programming-related content. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping you find something useful here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using kubectl via an SSH Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/06/16/using-kubectl-via-an-ssh-tunnel/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Jun 2020 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/06/16/using-kubectl-via-an-ssh-tunnel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share one way (not the only way!) to use &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; to access your &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; cluster via an SSH tunnel. In the future, I may explore some other ways (hit &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/scott_lowe&#34;&gt;me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re interested). I&amp;rsquo;m sharing this information because I suspect it is not uncommon for folks deploying Kubernetes on the public cloud to want to deploy them in a way that does not expose them to the Internet. Given that the use of SSH bastion hosts is not uncommon, it seemed reasonable to show how one could use an SSH tunnel to reach a Kubernetes cluster behind an SSH bastion host.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #126! I meant to get this published last Friday, but completely forgot. So, I added a couple more links and instead have it ready for you today. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any links for servers/hardware or security in today&amp;rsquo;s Short Take, but hopefully there&amp;rsquo;s enough linked content in the other sections that you&amp;rsquo;ll still find something useful. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #124! It seems like the natural progression of the Tech Short Takes is moving toward monthly articles, since it&amp;rsquo;s been about a month since my last one. In any case, here&amp;rsquo;s hoping that I&amp;rsquo;ve found something useful for you. Enjoy! (And yes, normally I&amp;rsquo;d publish this on a Friday, but I messed up and forgot. So, I decided to publish on Monday instead of waiting for Friday.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #122! Luckily I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; manage to get another Tech Short Take squeezed in for 2019, just so all my readers could have some reading materials for the holidays. I&amp;rsquo;m kidding! No, I mean I really am kidding&amp;mdash;don&amp;rsquo;t read stuff over the holidays. Spend time with your family instead. The investment in your family will pay off in later years, trust me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Accessing the Docker Daemon via an SSH Bastion Host</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2019/08/01/accessing-docker-daemon-via-ssh-bastion-host/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2019/08/01/accessing-docker-daemon-via-ssh-bastion-host/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@sujaypillai/dockertips-connect-to-docker-daemon-over-ssh-using-docker-compose-f4b189dd8951&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, which informed me that (as of the 18.09 release) you can use SSH to connect to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; daemon remotely. That&amp;rsquo;s handy! The article uses &lt;code&gt;docker-machine&lt;/code&gt; (a useful but underrated tool, I think) to demonstrate, but the first question in my mind was this: can I do this through an SSH bastion host? Read on for the answer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #115! I&amp;rsquo;m back from my much-needed vacation in Bali, and getting settled back into work and my daily routine (which, for the last few weeks, was mostly swimming in the pool and sitting on the beach). Here&amp;rsquo;s a fresh new collection of links and articles from the around the web to propel myself back into blogging. I hope you find something useful here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #113! I hope the collection of links and articles I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered for you contains something useful for you. I think I have a pretty balanced collection this time around; there&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of something for almost everyone. Who says you can&amp;rsquo;t please everyone all the time?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #112! It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since the last one, as life and work have been keeping me busy. I have, however, finally managed to pull together this list of links and articles from around the Internet, and I hope that something I&amp;rsquo;ve included here proves useful to readers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month&amp;mdash;May 2018&amp;mdash;marks &lt;strong&gt;thirteen years&lt;/strong&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ve been generating content here on this site. It&amp;rsquo;s been a phenomenal 13 years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed the opportunity to share information with readers around the world. To celebrate, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do a quick &amp;ldquo;Posts from the Past&amp;rdquo; and highlight some content from previous years. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take 92, the first Technology Short Take of 2018. This one was &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be the last Tech Short Take of 2017, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get it published in time (I decided to spend time with my family instead&amp;mdash;some things are just more important). In any case, hopefully the delay of one additional week hasn&amp;rsquo;t caused any undue stress&amp;mdash;let&amp;rsquo;s jump right in!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
