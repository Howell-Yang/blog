      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #152! Normally I&amp;rsquo;d publish a Technology Short Take in the morning on a Friday, but I really wanted to get this one out so I&amp;rsquo;m making it live late in the day on a Monday. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping I&amp;rsquo;ve included some content below that you find useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #151, the first Technology Short Take of 2022. I hope everyone had a great holiday season and that 2022 is off to a wonderful start! I have a few more links than normal this time around, although I didn&amp;rsquo;t find articles in a couple categories. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;ll keep my eyes peeled and my RSS reader ready to pull in new articles in those categories for next time. And now for the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #146! Over the last couple of weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered a few technology-related links for you all. There&amp;rsquo;s some networking stuff, a few security links, and even a hardware-related article. But enough with the introduction&amp;mdash;let&amp;rsquo;s get into the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #145! What will you find in this Tech Short Take? Well, let&amp;rsquo;s see&amp;hellip;stuff on Envoy, network automation, network designs, M1 chips (and potential open source variants!), a bevy of security articles (including a couple on very severe vulnerabilities), Kubernetes, AWS IAM, and so much more! I hope that you find something useful here. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #143! I have what I think is an interesting list of links to share with you this time around. Since taking my new job at Kong, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending more time with Envoy, so you&amp;rsquo;ll see some Envoy-related content showing up in this Technology Short Take. I hope this collection of links has something useful for you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #139! This Technology Short Take is a bit heavy on cloud, OS, and programming topics, but there should be enough other interesting links to be useful to plenty of folks. (At least, I hope that&amp;rsquo;s the case!) Now, let&amp;rsquo;s get on to the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #128! It looks like I&amp;rsquo;m settling into a roughly monthly cadence with the Technology Short Takes. This time around, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a (hopefully) interesting collection of links. The collection seems a tad heavier than normal in the hardware and security sections, probably due to new exploits discovered in Intel&amp;rsquo;s speculative execution functionality. In any case, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered for you. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #124! It seems like the natural progression of the Tech Short Takes is moving toward monthly articles, since it&amp;rsquo;s been about a month since my last one. In any case, here&amp;rsquo;s hoping that I&amp;rsquo;ve found something useful for you. Enjoy! (And yes, normally I&amp;rsquo;d publish this on a Friday, but I messed up and forgot. So, I decided to publish on Monday instead of waiting for Friday.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Enjoy some light reading over your festive holiday season!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #117!

Here&amp;rsquo;s a fresh new collection of links and articles from the around the web to propel myself back into blogging. I hope you find something useful here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
