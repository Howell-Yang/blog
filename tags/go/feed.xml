      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #155, just in time for the 2022 Memorial Day holiday weekend! (Here in the US, at least.) I mean, don&amp;rsquo;t you want to spend this weekend catching up on some technology-related articles instead of cooking on the grill and gathering with friends and family? I certainly hope not! Still, for those who need a little technology fix over the weekend, hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ve included something useful in the list of articles below. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #144! I have a fairly diverse set of links for readers this time around, covering topics from microchips to improving your writing, with stops along the way in topics like Kubernetes, virtualization, Linux, and the popular JSON-parsing tool &lt;code&gt;jq&lt;/code&gt;. I hope you find something useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Establishing VPC Peering with Pulumi and Go</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pulumi.com/&#34;&gt;Pulumi&lt;/a&gt; to manage my lab infrastructure on &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/&#34;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; (I shared some of the details in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pulumi.com/blog/supporting-kubernetes-with-pulumi/&#34;&gt;this April 2020 blog post&lt;/a&gt; published on the Pulumi site). Originally I started with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.typescriptlang.org/&#34;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt;, but later switched to &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;. Recently I had a need to add some VPC peering relationships to my lab configuration. I was concerned that this may pose some problems&amp;mdash;due entirely to the way I structure my Pulumi projects and stacks&amp;mdash;but as it turned out it was more straightforward than I expected. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share some example code and explain what I learned in the process of writing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #143! I have what I think is an interesting list of links to share with you this time around. Since taking my new job at Kong, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending more time with Envoy, so you&amp;rsquo;ll see some Envoy-related content showing up in this Technology Short Take. I hope this collection of links has something useful for you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #142! This time around, the Networking section is a bit light, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got plenty of cloud computing links and articles for you to enjoy, along with some stuff on OSes and applications, programming, and soft skills. Hopefully there&amp;rsquo;s something useful here for you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #141! This is the first Technology Short Take compiled, written, and published entirely on my M1-based MacBook Pro (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2021/06/02/review-2020-m1-based-macbook-pro/&#34;&gt;my review here&lt;/a&gt;). The collection of links shared below covers a fairly wide range of topics, from old Sun hardware to working with serverless frameworks in the public cloud. I hope that you find something useful here. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #140! It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe it&amp;rsquo;s already the start of May 2021&amp;mdash;my how time flies! In this Technology Short Take, I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered some links for you covering topics like Azure and AWS networking, moving from macOS to Linux (and back again), and more. Let&amp;rsquo;s jump right into the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #139! This Technology Short Take is a bit heavy on cloud, OS, and programming topics, but there should be enough other interesting links to be useful to plenty of folks. (At least, I hope that&amp;rsquo;s the case!) Now, let&amp;rsquo;s get on to the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #135! This will likely be the last Technology Short Take of 2020, so it&amp;rsquo;s a tad longer than usual. Sorry about that! You know me&amp;mdash;I just want to make sure everyone has plenty of technical content to read during the holidays. And speaking of holidays&amp;hellip;whatever holidays you do (or don&amp;rsquo;t) celebrate, I hope that the rest of the year is a good one for you. Now, on to the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #132! My list of links and articles from around the web seems to be a bit heavy on security-related topics this time. Still, there&amp;rsquo;s a decent collection of networking, cloud computing, and virtualization articles as well as a smattering of other topics for you to peruse. I hope you find something useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating an AWS ELB using Pulumi and Go</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/07/29/creating-an-aws-elb-using-pulumi-and-go/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/07/29/creating-an-aws-elb-using-pulumi-and-go/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In case you hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed, I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a bit of a kick with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pulumi.com/&#34;&gt;Pulumi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; recently. There are two reasons for this. First, I have a number of &amp;ldquo;learning projects&amp;rdquo; (things that I decide I&amp;rsquo;d like to try or test) that would benefit greatly from the use of infrastructure as code. Second, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on getting more familiar with Go. The idea of combining both those reasons by using Pulumi with Go seemed natural. Unfortunately, examples of using Pulumi with Go seem to be more limited than examples of using Pulumi with other languages, so in this post I&amp;rsquo;d like to share how to create an AWS ELB using Pulumi and Go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #129, where I&amp;rsquo;ve collected a bunch of links and references to technology-centric resources around the Internet. This collection is (mostly) data center- and cloud-focused, and hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to curate a list that has some useful information for readers. Sorry this got published so late; it was supposed to go live this morning!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating an AWS Security Group using Pulumi and Go</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/07/01/creating-aws-security-group-using-pulumi-and-go/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/07/01/creating-aws-security-group-using-pulumi-and-go/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to share some examples of how to create an AWS security group using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pulumi.com/&#34;&gt;Pulumi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m sharing these examples because&amp;mdash;as of this writing&amp;mdash;the Pulumi site does not provide any examples on how this is done using Go. There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; examples for the other languages supported by Pulumi, but not for Go. The syntax is, to me at least, somewhat counterintuitive, although I freely admit this could be due to the fact that I am still pretty new to Go and its syntax.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adopting the Default Route Table of an AWS VPC using Pulumi and Go</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/06/25/adopting-default-route-table-aws-vpc-using-pulumi-go/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2020 10:15:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/06/25/adopting-default-route-table-aws-vpc-using-pulumi-go/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Up until now, when I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pulumi.com/&#34;&gt;Pulumi&lt;/a&gt; to create infrastructure on AWS, my code would create all-new infrastructure: a new VPC, new subnets, new route tables, new Internet gateway, etc. One thing bothered me, though: when I created a new VPC, that new VPC automatically came with a default route table. My code, however, would create a new route table and then explicitly associate the subnets with that new route table. This seemed less than ideal. (What can I say? I&amp;rsquo;m a stickler for details.) While building a &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;-based replacement for my existing TypeScript code, I found a way to resolve this duplication of resources. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to &amp;ldquo;adopt&amp;rdquo; the default route table of an AWS VPC so that you can manage it in your Pulumi code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
