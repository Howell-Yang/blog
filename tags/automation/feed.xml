      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #149! I&amp;rsquo;ll have one more Technology Short Take in 2021, scheduled for three weeks from now (on the last day of the year!). For now, though, I have a small collection of articles and links for your reading pleasure&amp;mdash;not as many as I usually include in a Technology Short Take, but better than nothing at all (I hope!). Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #143! I have what I think is an interesting list of links to share with you this time around. Since taking my new job at Kong, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending more time with Envoy, so you&amp;rsquo;ll see some Envoy-related content showing up in this Technology Short Take. I hope this collection of links has something useful for you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Considerations for using IaC with Cluster API</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/10/08/considerations-for-using-iac-with-cluster-api/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In other posts on this site, I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about both infrastructure-as-code (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/tags/terraform&#34;&gt;my posts on Terraform&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/tags/pulumi&#34;&gt;my posts on Pulumi&lt;/a&gt;) and somewhat separately I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about Cluster API (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/tags/capi&#34;&gt;my posts on Cluster API&lt;/a&gt;). And while I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed the idea of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2019/09/09/consuming-preexisting-aws-infrastructure-with-cluster-api/&#34;&gt;using existing AWS infrastructure with Cluster API&lt;/a&gt;, in this post I wanted to try to think about how these two technologies play together, and provide some considerations for using them together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #130! I&amp;rsquo;ve had this blog post sitting in my Drafts folder waiting to be published for almost a month, and I kept forgetting to actually make it live. Sorry! So, here it is&amp;mdash;better late than never, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #129, where I&amp;rsquo;ve collected a bunch of links and references to technology-centric resources around the Internet. This collection is (mostly) data center- and cloud-focused, and hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to curate a list that has some useful information for readers. Sorry this got published so late; it was supposed to go live this morning!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating an AWS Security Group using Pulumi and Go</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/07/01/creating-aws-security-group-using-pulumi-and-go/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to share some examples of how to create an AWS security group using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pulumi.com/&#34;&gt;Pulumi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m sharing these examples because&amp;mdash;as of this writing&amp;mdash;the Pulumi site does not provide any examples on how this is done using Go. There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; examples for the other languages supported by Pulumi, but not for Go. The syntax is, to me at least, somewhat counterintuitive, although I freely admit this could be due to the fact that I am still pretty new to Go and its syntax.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adopting the Default Route Table of an AWS VPC using Pulumi and Go</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/06/25/adopting-default-route-table-aws-vpc-using-pulumi-go/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/06/25/adopting-default-route-table-aws-vpc-using-pulumi-go/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Up until now, when I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pulumi.com/&#34;&gt;Pulumi&lt;/a&gt; to create infrastructure on AWS, my code would create all-new infrastructure: a new VPC, new subnets, new route tables, new Internet gateway, etc. One thing bothered me, though: when I created a new VPC, that new VPC automatically came with a default route table. My code, however, would create a new route table and then explicitly associate the subnets with that new route table. This seemed less than ideal. (What can I say? I&amp;rsquo;m a stickler for details.) While building a &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;-based replacement for my existing TypeScript code, I found a way to resolve this duplication of resources. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to &amp;ldquo;adopt&amp;rdquo; the default route table of an AWS VPC so that you can manage it in your Pulumi code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Technology Short Take 128</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #128! It looks like I&amp;rsquo;m settling into a roughly monthly cadence with the Technology Short Takes. This time around, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a (hopefully) interesting collection of links. The collection seems a tad heavier than normal in the hardware and security sections, probably due to new exploits discovered in Intel&amp;rsquo;s speculative execution functionality. In any case, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered for you. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating a Multi-AZ NAT Gateway with Pulumi</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/06/09/creating-multi-az-nat-gateway-with-pulumi/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/06/09/creating-multi-az-nat-gateway-with-pulumi/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had a need to test a configuration involving the use of a single NAT Gateway servicing multiple private subnets across multiple availability zones (AZs) within a single VPC. While there are notable caveats with such a design (see the &amp;ldquo;Caveats&amp;rdquo; section at the bottom of this article), it could make sense in some use cases. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.typescriptlang.org/&#34;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pulumi.com/&#34;&gt;Pulumi&lt;/a&gt; to automate the creation of this design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #126! I meant to get this published last Friday, but completely forgot. So, I added a couple more links and instead have it ready for you today. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any links for servers/hardware or security in today&amp;rsquo;s Short Take, but hopefully there&amp;rsquo;s enough linked content in the other sections that you&amp;rsquo;ll still find something useful. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #124! It seems like the natural progression of the Tech Short Takes is moving toward monthly articles, since it&amp;rsquo;s been about a month since my last one. In any case, here&amp;rsquo;s hoping that I&amp;rsquo;ve found something useful for you. Enjoy! (And yes, normally I&amp;rsquo;d publish this on a Friday, but I messed up and forgot. So, I decided to publish on Monday instead of waiting for Friday.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating an AWS VPC Endpoint with Pulumi</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/01/25/creating-aws-vpc-endpoint-with-pulumi/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to show readers how to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pulumi.com/&#34;&gt;Pulumi&lt;/a&gt; to create a VPC endpoint on AWS. Until recently, I&amp;rsquo;d heard of VPC endpoints but hadn&amp;rsquo;t really taken the time to fully understand what they were or how they might be used. That changed when I was presented with a requirement for the AWS EC2 APIs to be available within a VPC that did not have Internet access. As it turns out&amp;mdash;and as many readers are probably already aware&amp;mdash;this is one of the key use cases for a VPC endpoint (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html&#34;&gt;the VPC endpoint docs&lt;/a&gt;). The sample code I&amp;rsquo;ll share below shows how to programmatically create a VPC endpoint for use in infrastructure-as-code use cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s my latest gathering of links and articles from the around the World Wide Web (an &amp;ldquo;old school&amp;rdquo; reference for you right there). I&amp;rsquo;ve got a little bit of something for most everyone, except for the storage nerds (I&amp;rsquo;m leaving that to my friend J Metz this time around). Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping you find something useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #116! This one is a bit shorter than usual, due to holidays in the US and my life being busy. Nevertheless, I hope that I managed to capture something you find useful or helpful. As always, your feedback is welcome, so if you have suggestions, corrections, or comments, you&amp;rsquo;re welcome to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/scott_lowe&#34;&gt;contact me via Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #115! I&amp;rsquo;m back from my much-needed vacation in Bali, and getting settled back into work and my daily routine (which, for the last few weeks, was mostly swimming in the pool and sitting on the beach). Here&amp;rsquo;s a fresh new collection of links and articles from the around the web to propel myself back into blogging. I hope you find something useful here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
