      <description>I had a reader contact me with a question on using Kerberos and LDAP for authentication into Active Directory, based on Active Directory integration work I did many years ago. I was unable to help him, but he did find the solution to the problem, and I wanted to share it here in case it might help others.
The issue was that he was experiencing a problem using native Kerberos authentication against Active Directory with SSH.</description>

      <title>Linux-AD Integration Issue: Persistent Connections</title>

      <description>A reader contacted me a short while ago to inquire about a problem he was having with his Linux-AD integration efforts. It seems he had recently added a new domain controller (DC) that was intended to be a DC for a disaster recovery (DR) site. When he took this new DR DC offline in order to physically move it to the DR site, some of his AD-integrated Linux systems started failing to authenticate.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, folks, but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to have the time or the resources to publish an update to my existing instructions for integrating Solaris 10 into Active Directory. Quite some time ago I had posted that I planned on creating an update to the original instructions so as to incorporate some lessons learned, but it keeps get pushed aside for other tasks that are more important and more relevant to my day-to-day work.</description>

      <description>Reader Scott Merrill pointed out something to me in an e-mail regarding a Registry change that might be necessary in some Active Directory integration scenarios:
 Finally, I would like to share one registry change that we&amp;rsquo;ve found to be necessary in our AD integration. By default, the MS LDAP server only returns 1,000 results. As a university department with more than 1000 active students, this limitation has caused us some frustration.</description>

      <description>Reader Jeffrey Spear contacted me a while back with some problems he was experiencing in trying to integrate some Linux systems into Active Directory. Basically, Kerberos was working but LDAP wasn&amp;rsquo;t. He was able to use kinit &amp;lt;AD username&amp;gt; to generate a Kerberos ticket, but using the getent passwd &amp;lt;AD username&amp;gt; was not working. No error messages, nothing; it just didn&amp;rsquo;t work.
We traded e-mails back and forth for a while, and eventually he found the solution himself:</description>

      <title>Local Logins Refused in AD Integration Scenarios</title>

      <description>A customer with whom I had worked to fully integrate their ESX Server systems into Active Directory&amp;mdash;using my instructions here&amp;mdash;had run into a problem. The problem was that local logins were refused when the Service Console lost network connectivity. Clearly, this was a problem; if the customer couldn&amp;rsquo;t login as root when the network is down, even locally at the console, then we have problems. So I set out today to isolate and fix the problem.</description>

      <description>I wanted to take just a brief moment and let everyone know about a few articles that I&amp;rsquo;ve got &amp;ldquo;in the pipeline&amp;rdquo; for the site. If there is one&amp;mdash;or more&amp;mdash;of these articles that looks particularly interesting, speak up in the comments.
Here are the articles that are currently under development:
  An update to the Solaris-AD integration instructions: Last time I ran through these instructions I came across a number of discrepancies and little &amp;ldquo;gotchas.</description>

      <description>This afternoon, I walked back through my own instructions for integrating Solaris 10 and Active Directory, and I found that the process wasn&amp;rsquo;t as smooth as perhaps I&amp;rsquo;d believed it to be. As a result of walking back through the process again myself, I&amp;rsquo;ve collected some notes. At some point in the near future, these notes will be integrated into a new version of the Solaris-AD integration instructions.
So, without further ado, here are the notes I collected in no particular order:</description>

      <description>A reader kindly shared with me some tips and tweaks he used to help resolve some performance issues with Linux-AD integration, and now I&amp;rsquo;d like to share them with you:
 I ran into some nagging performance issues with Linux/AD integration the other day, and managed to solve them (mostly)&amp;mdash;I thought you might be interested in the solution.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly following your integration guide (I use DNS lookups to locate LDAP servers in AD, and use GSSAPI authentication for nss_ldap instead of a binddn), I have a bit more overhead on my getent system calls, that was starting to get noticable when it came to getting directory listings, etc.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve received some feedback from a reader who alerted me to some sort of interaction between the Local Security Policy on the Windows side and Linux servers authenticating to Active Directory via Kerberos/LDAP/Samba. I haven&amp;rsquo;t quite been able to get to the root issue yet, but here&amp;rsquo;s the high level overview.
The reader was seeing strange delays at the end of a Linux logon process that seemingly could not be explained.</description>

      <description>I was going through my list of flagged headlines in NetNewsWire and realized that I&amp;rsquo;d built up quite a list of articles that I intended to write something about. Some of them just don&amp;rsquo;t merit a full-blown post, though, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d just toss a bunch of them in here along with a brief sentence or two about them:
  VMTN Discussion Forums: vdiskmanager GUI for OSX: An enterprising Fusion user has written an OS X GUI for vdiskmanager, so that VMDKs on Fusion can be expanded or defragmented, or new virtual disks can be created.</description>

      <description>Regular readers of this blog know that I like to work on integrating various systems into Active Directory. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a couple of articles on the issue:
Linux-AD Integration, Version 4
Solaris 10-AD Integration, Version 3
Active Directory Integration Index
These articles have been pretty successful and from what I understand have helped a fair number of people integrate their non-Windows systems into Active Directory for simplified user management and authentication.</description>

      <description>Although much of the administration of servers running VMware ESX Server 3.0 will occur in the Windows-based Virtual Infrastructure client connected to a VirtualCenter server, there are times when it is quicker or easier to perform an administrative task directly on the ESX Server itself&amp;mdash;either via the command-line interface (CLI) or via the VI client authenticating directly against the ESX Server. The problem with this is that, by default, administrators will have to use different credentials when connecting the VI client to ESX Server directly.</description>

      <description>In the event that your organization is considering a migration later this year (or next?) to Windows Server 2008 (formerly &amp;ldquo;Longhorn&amp;rdquo;), here are some instructions for integrating Linux login requests against Active Directory on Windows Server 2008. These instructions are based on Linux-AD Integration, Version 4 and utilize Kerberos, LDAP, and Samba.
When this process is complete, AD users can be enabled for use on Linux systems on the network and login to those Linux systems using the same username and password as throughout the rest of Active Directory.</description>

      <title>Solaris 10-AD Integration, Version 3</title>

      <description>Thanks to some very helpful individuals in the #solaris channel on irc.freenode.net, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to get ADS support working in Samba on Solaris 10, and thus have been able to incorporate the use of Samba in the Solaris 10-AD integration instructions.
To refer to earlier versions of the Solaris 10-AD integration instructions, see this article or this article. I would expect that you won&amp;rsquo;t need to refer to those posts, though, and will be able to get most of what you need directly from this post.</description>
