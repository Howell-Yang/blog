      <description>Yesterday I published a short post titled &amp;ldquo;I/O Virtualization and the Double-Edged Sword&amp;rdquo;. In that post, I discussed how Xsigo was criticizing FCoE for &amp;ldquo;not going far enough&amp;rdquo; in the realm of I/O virtualization. Unfortunately, I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a very good job of really getting my point across, because the discussion rapidly turned into a discussion of the merits of various interconnect technologies and why one might win over the other.</description>

      <description>I recently came across this blog entry over at Xsigo&amp;rsquo;s new corporate blog, I/O Unplugged. A key phrase in this blog entry really caught my eye:
 The reality is that FCoE solves neither the complexity nor the management problems. It is a minor change to the status quo when a major leap forward comparable to server virtualization is needed for I/O.
 At first glance, I&amp;rsquo;d say they are right.</description>

      <description>For the last few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the privilege of using a Xsigo Systems VP780 I/O Director in my lab. After using the product for these past few weeks, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share a few tips and tricks for integrating the product into your VMware Infrastructure 3 (VI3) environment.
Jumbo Frames If you want to use jumbo frames in your VI3 environment with the VP780, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to set the MTU on the Ethernet ports before creating any vNICs.</description>
