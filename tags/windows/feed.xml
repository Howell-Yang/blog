      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #135! This will likely be the last Technology Short Take of 2020, so it&amp;rsquo;s a tad longer than usual. Sorry about that! You know me&amp;mdash;I just want to make sure everyone has plenty of technical content to read during the holidays. And speaking of holidays&amp;hellip;whatever holidays you do (or don&amp;rsquo;t) celebrate, I hope that the rest of the year is a good one for you. Now, on to the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #131! I&amp;rsquo;m back with another collection of articles on various data center technologies. This time around the content is a tad heavy on the security side, but I&amp;rsquo;ve still managed to pull in articles on networking, cloud computing, applications, and some programming-related content. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping you find something useful here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #130! I&amp;rsquo;ve had this blog post sitting in my Drafts folder waiting to be published for almost a month, and I kept forgetting to actually make it live. Sorry! So, here it is&amp;mdash;better late than never, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Unison Across Linux, macOS, and Windows</title>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/06/01/using-unison-across-linux-macos-windows/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently wrapped up an instance where I needed to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/index.html&#34;&gt;Unison file synchronization application&lt;/a&gt; across Linux, macOS, and Windows. While Unison &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; available for all three platforms and &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; work across (and among) systems running all three operating systems, I did encounter a few interoperability issues while making it work. Here&amp;rsquo;s some information on these interoperability issues, and how I worked around them. (Hopefully this information will help someone else.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #124! It seems like the natural progression of the Tech Short Takes is moving toward monthly articles, since it&amp;rsquo;s been about a month since my last one. In any case, here&amp;rsquo;s hoping that I&amp;rsquo;ve found something useful for you. Enjoy! (And yes, normally I&amp;rsquo;d publish this on a Friday, but I messed up and forgot. So, I decided to publish on Monday instead of waiting for Friday.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #123, the first of 2020! I hope that everyone had a wonderful holiday season, but now it&amp;rsquo;s time to jump back into the fray with a collection of technical articles from around the Internet. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping that I found something useful for you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #112! It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since the last one, as life and work have been keeping me busy. I have, however, finally managed to pull together this list of links and articles from around the Internet, and I hope that something I&amp;rsquo;ve included here proves useful to readers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #98! Now that I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get settled into my new role at Heptio, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to find some time to pull together another collection of links and articles pertaining to various data center technologies. Feedback is always welcome!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take 97! This Tech Short Take marks the end of an era (sort of); it&amp;rsquo;s the last Tech Short Take published while I&amp;rsquo;m a VMware employee (today is my last day; see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2018/03/26/time-to-evolve/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more details). But enough about me&amp;mdash;let&amp;rsquo;s talk some tech! This Short Take may be a bit longer than some, so buckle up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take 94! Ready for another round of links, articles, and thoughts on data center technologies? (Who knows, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll throw a rant or two in there.) OK, enough rambling&amp;hellip;here&amp;rsquo;s the good stuff!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take 92, the first Technology Short Take of 2018. This one was &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be the last Tech Short Take of 2017, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get it published in time (I decided to spend time with my family instead&amp;mdash;some things are just more important). In any case, hopefully the delay of one additional week hasn&amp;rsquo;t caused any undue stress&amp;mdash;let&amp;rsquo;s jump right in!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take 91! It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit longer than usual since the last Tech Short Take (partly due to the US Thanksgiving holiday, partly due to vacation time, and partly due to business travel), so apologies for that. Still, there&amp;rsquo;s a great collection of links and articles here for you, so dig in and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #85! This is my irregularly-published collection of links and articles from around the Internet related to the major data center technologies: networking, hardware, security, cloud computing, applications/OSes, storage, and virtualization. Plus, just for fun, I usually try to include a couple career-related links as well. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
