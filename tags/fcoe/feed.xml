      <description>This year at VMworld, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in any of the breakout sessions because employees aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to register for breakout sessions in advance; we have to wait in the standby line to see if we can get in at the last minute. So, I decided to meet with some vendors that seemed interesting and get some additional information on their products. Here&amp;rsquo;s the write-up on some of the vendor meetings I&amp;rsquo;ve attended while in San Francisco.</description>

      <description>This is session CLDS006, &amp;ldquo;Exploring New Intel Xeon Processor E5 Based Platform Optimizations for 10 Gb Ethernet Network Infrastructures.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s a long title! The speakers are Brian Johnson from Intel and Alex Rodriguez with Expedient.
The session starts with Rodriguez giving a (thankfully) brief overview of Expedient and then getting into the evolution of networking with 10 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE). Rodriguez provides the usual &amp;ldquo;massive growth&amp;rdquo; numbers that necessitated Expedient&amp;rsquo;s relatively recent migration to 10 GbE in their data center.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Technology Short Take #23, another collection of links and thoughts related to data center technologies like networking, storage, security, cloud computing, and virtualization. As usual, we have a fairly wide-ranging collection of items this time around. Enjoy!
Networking   A couple of days ago I learned that there are a couple open source implementations of LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol). There&amp;rsquo;s OpenLISP, which runs on FreeBSD, and there&amp;rsquo;s also a project called LISPmob that brings LISP to Linux.</description>

      <title>Thinking Out Loud: Is A dvFabric Closer Than We Think?</title>

      <description>This is a short post, but one that I hope will stir some discussion.
Earlier this evening, I read Maish&amp;rsquo;s blog post titled My Wish for dvFabric&amp;mdash;a dvSwitch for Storage. In that blog post Maish describes a self-configuring storage fabric that would simplify how we provision storage in a vSphere environment. Here&amp;rsquo;s how Maish describes the dvFabric:
 So how do I envision this dvFabric? Essentially the same as a dvSwitch.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Technology Short Take #20, the latest collection of various data center-related links, articles, and thoughts. I hope you find something useful here.
Networking   For all the writing and thinking I&amp;rsquo;ve done on VXLAN (here, here, and here), someone (thanks Ed!) mentioned something to me recently that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even considered. (It&amp;rsquo;s so simple I&amp;rsquo;m embarrassed that I overlooked it.) VXLAN uses UDP for its encapsulation. What about dropped packets, lack of sequencing, etc.</description>

      <description>I recently read over Stephen Foskett&amp;rsquo;s Eight Unresolved Questions About FCoE article, in which he outlines eight topics that should be addressed/prioritized in order to make FCoE, in his words, &amp;ldquo;truly world-class&amp;rdquo;.
One of these topics was virtual machine mobility. Here&amp;rsquo;s what Stephen wrote under the heading &amp;ldquo;How Do You Handle Virtual Machine Mobility?&amp;rdquo;:
 As I described recently, virtual machine mobility is a major technical challenge for existing networks. The VMware proposal, the VXLAN, seems to be gaining traction right now.</description>

      <title>Setting up Software FCoE on vSphere 5</title>

      <description>One of the features added in vSphere 5 was a software FCoE initiator. This is a feature that has gotten relatively little attention, other than a brief mention here and there. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure why the software FCoE initiator in vSphere 5 hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten more attention, but this past week I had the opportunity to work with the software FCoE initiator in a bit more detail. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to describe in a bit more detail how to set up the software FCoE initiator; in future posts, I hope to be able to provide some performance and troubleshooting information.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Technology Short Take #17, another of my irregularly-scheduled collections of various data center technology-related links, thoughts, and comments. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping you find something useful!
Networking   I think it was J Metz of Cisco that posted this to Twitter, but this is a good reference to the various 10 Gigabit Ethernet modules.
  I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken quite a bit about stretched clusters and their potential benefits. For an opposing view&amp;mdash;especially regarding the use of stretched clusters as a disaster avoidance solution&amp;mdash;check out this article.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Technology Short Take #16. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since my last Technology Short Take (a month!), and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing (so readers didn&amp;rsquo;t have to listen to my rambling) or a bad thing (readers missing out on what I hope are useful or interesting links). In any case, here&amp;rsquo;s my latest collection of various data center-related links, articles, and thoughts. Thanks for reading!</description>

      <description>Welcome to Technology Short Take #15, the latest in my irregular series of posts on various articles and links on networking, servers, storage, and virtualization&amp;mdash;everything a growing data center engineer needs!
Networking My thoughts this time around are pretty heavily focused on VXLAN, which continues to get lots of attention. I talked about posting a dissection of VXLAN, but I have failed miserably; fortunately, other people smarter than me have stepped up to the plate.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Technology Short Take #14, another collection of links and tidbits of information I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered over the last few weeks. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive right in!
Networking Much of my focus in the networking space recently has been around virtualization-centric initiatives, so the items on this list might seem a bit skewed in that direction. Sorry!
  I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some reading on 802.1Qbg (Edge Virtual Bridging). I still have a long way to go, but I think that I&amp;rsquo;m starting to better understand this draft and the problem(s) it&amp;rsquo;s attempting to address.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Technology Short Take #13. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last Technology Short Take, and much has happened (vSphere 5 was announced, HP discontinued the TouchPad and webOS, and I announced my move to Denver). Here are a few data center technology-related links that stood out to me over the last few weeks. I hope you find something useful!
Networking   Here&amp;rsquo;s a good post by Jeremy Waldrop on Cisco Nexus 5000/7000 FEX (fabric extender) topologies.</description>

      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve published the Storage Edition of Technology Short Take #12, it&amp;rsquo;s time for the Networking Edition. Enjoy, and I hope you find something useful!
  Ron Fuller&amp;rsquo;s ongoing deep dive series on OTV (Overlay Transport Virtualization) has been great for me. I knew about the basics of OTV, but Ron&amp;rsquo;s articles really gave me a better understanding of the technology. Check out the first three articles here: part 1, part 2, and part 3.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m so far behind in my technology reading that I have this massive list of blog posts and links that I would normally put into an issue of Technology Short Takes. However, people are already &amp;ldquo;complaining&amp;rdquo; that my Short Takes aren&amp;rsquo;t all that short. To keep from overwhelming people, I&amp;rsquo;m breaking Technology Short Take #12 into three editions: Virtualization, Storage, and Networking.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;Storage Edition&amp;rdquo; of Technology Short Take #12!</description>

      <description>Cisco had a pretty major product/technology launch today. I was briefed on the product launch some time ago&amp;mdash;one of the perks of being a &amp;ldquo;leading blogger&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and so it was great to see this stuff finally come to light. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to read some of the other blog posts on the topic (I know there have been several), so I apologize for any duplication.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look at the &amp;ldquo;new product&amp;rdquo; news included in the launch:</description>
