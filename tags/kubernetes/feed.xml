      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #155, just in time for the 2022 Memorial Day holiday weekend! (Here in the US, at least.) I mean, don&amp;rsquo;t you want to spend this weekend catching up on some technology-related articles instead of cooking on the grill and gathering with friends and family? I certainly hope not! Still, for those who need a little technology fix over the weekend, hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ve included something useful in the list of articles below. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Control Plane Access with Cluster API</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2022/05/12/fine-tuning-control-plane-access-with-cluster-api/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&#34;https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io&#34;&gt;Cluster API&lt;/a&gt; creates a workload cluster, it also creates a load balancing solution to handle traffic to the workload cluster&amp;rsquo;s control plane. This is necessary so that the control plane endpoint is decoupled from the underlying control plane nodes (which facilitates scaling the control plane, among other things). On AWS, this mean creating an ELB and a set of security groups. For flexibility, Cluster API provides a limited ability to customize this control plane load balancer. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to use this functionality to fine-tune access to a workload cluster&amp;rsquo;s control plane when using Cluster API with AWS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #154! My link of links and articles from around the Internet is a bit light on networking and virtualization this time around, but heftier in the security, cloud, and OS/application sections. I hope that I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to include something that you&amp;rsquo;ll find useful. Enjoy the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #153! My personal and professional life has kept me busy over the last couple of months, so things have been quiet here on the blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve still been collecting links to share with you, though, and here&amp;rsquo;s the latest collection. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re able to find something useful here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #152! Normally I&amp;rsquo;d publish a Technology Short Take in the morning on a Friday, but I really wanted to get this one out so I&amp;rsquo;m making it live late in the day on a Monday. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping I&amp;rsquo;ve included some content below that you find useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using cert-manager with Kuma for mTLS</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2022/02/17/using-cert-manager-with-kuma-mtls/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When configuring mutual TLS (mTLS) on &lt;a href=&#34;https://kuma.io/&#34;&gt;the open source Kuma service mesh&lt;/a&gt;, users have a couple of different options. They can use a &amp;ldquo;builtin&amp;rdquo; certificate authority (CA), in which Kuma itself will generate a CA certificate and key for use in creating service-specific mTLS certificates. Users also have the option of using a &amp;ldquo;provided&amp;rdquo; CA, in which they must supply a CA certificate and key for Kuma to use when creating service-specific mTLS certificates. Both of these options are described &lt;a href=&#34;https://kuma.io/docs/1.4.x/policies/mutual-tls/&#34;&gt;on this page in the Kuma documentation&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore the use of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cert-manager.io/&#34;&gt;cert-manager&lt;/a&gt; as a &amp;ldquo;provided&amp;rdquo; CA for mTLS on Kuma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #151, the first Technology Short Take of 2022. I hope everyone had a great holiday season and that 2022 is off to a wonderful start! I have a few more links than normal this time around, although I didn&amp;rsquo;t find articles in a couple categories. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;ll keep my eyes peeled and my RSS reader ready to pull in new articles in those categories for next time. And now for the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Test-Driven Development for Kustomize Overlays</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2022/01/10/using-test-driven-development-for-kustomize-overlays/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am by no means a developer (not by a long shot!), but I have been learning lots of development-related things over the last several years and trying to incorporate those into my workflows. One of these is the idea of &lt;em&gt;test-driven development&lt;/em&gt; (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; for a definition and some additional information), in which one writes tests to validate functionality before writing the code to implement said functionality (pardon the paraphrasing). In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.conftest.dev/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;conftest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to (loosely) implement test-driven development for &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/kustomize/&#34;&gt;Kustomize&lt;/a&gt; overlays.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #150! This is the last Technology Short Take of 2021, so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll close the year out &amp;ldquo;with a bang&amp;rdquo; with this collection of links and articles on various technology areas. Bring on the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #149! I&amp;rsquo;ll have one more Technology Short Take in 2021, scheduled for three weeks from now (on the last day of the year!). For now, though, I have a small collection of articles and links for your reading pleasure&amp;mdash;not as many as I usually include in a Technology Short Take, but better than nothing at all (I hope!). Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #148, aka the Thanksgiving Edition (at least, for US readers). I&amp;rsquo;ve been scouring RSS feeds and various social media sites, collecting as many useful links and articles as I can find: from networking hardware and networking CI/CD pipelines to Kernel TLS and tricks for improving your working memory. That&amp;rsquo;s quite the range! I hope that you find something useful here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Kustomize Components with Cluster API</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2021/11/01/using-kustomize-components-with-cluster-api/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://kustomize.io&#34;&gt;Kustomize&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io&#34;&gt;Cluster API&lt;/a&gt; (CAPI) to manage my AWS-based &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io&#34;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; clusters for quite a while (along with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pulumi.com&#34;&gt;Pulumi&lt;/a&gt; for managing the underlying AWS infrastructure). For all the time I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this approach, I&amp;rsquo;ve also been unhappy with the overlay-based approach that had evolved as a way of managing multiple workload clusters. With the recent release of CAPI 1.0 and the v1beta1 API, I took this opportunity to see if there was a better way. I found a different way&amp;mdash;time will tell if it is a better way. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share how I&amp;rsquo;m using Kustomize components to help streamline managing multiple CAPI workload clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #147! The list of articles is a bit shorter than usual this time around, but I&amp;rsquo;ve still got a good collection of articles and posts covering topics in networking, hardware (mostly focused on Apple&amp;rsquo;s processors), cloud computing, and virtualization. There&amp;rsquo;s bound to be something in here for most everyone! (At least, I hope so.) Enjoy your weekend reading!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Influencing Cluster API AMI Selection</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2021/10/25/influencing-cluster-api-ami-selection/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes Cluster API (CAPI) project&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;which recently released v1.0&amp;mdash;can, if you wish, help manage the underlying infrastructure associated with a cluster. (You&amp;rsquo;re also fully able to have CAPI &lt;a href=&#34;https://cluster-api-aws.sigs.k8s.io/topics/consuming-existing-aws-infrastructure.html&#34;&gt;use existing infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; as well.) Speaking specifically of &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/&#34;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;, this means that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cluster-api-aws.sigs.k8s.io/&#34;&gt;Cluster API Provider for AWS&lt;/a&gt; is able to manage VPCs, subnets, routes and route tables, gateways, and&amp;mdash;of course&amp;mdash;EC2 instances. These EC2 instances are booted from a set of AMIs (Amazon Machine Images, definitely pronounced &amp;ldquo;ay-em-eye&amp;rdquo; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.technodrone.cloud/2019/03/ami-has-3-syllables-ami-aws.html&#34;&gt;three syllables&lt;/a&gt;) that are prepared and maintained by the CAPI project. In this short and simple post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to influence the AMI selection process that CAPI&amp;rsquo;s AWS provider uses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating Reusable Kuma Installation YAML</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2021/10/21/creating-reusable-kuma-installation-yaml/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2021/10/21/creating-reusable-kuma-installation-yaml/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using CLI tools&amp;mdash;instead of a &amp;ldquo;wall of YAML&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;to install things onto &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io&#34;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; is a growing trend, it seems. &lt;a href=&#34;https://istio.io&#34;&gt;Istio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cilium.io&#34;&gt;Cilium&lt;/a&gt;, for example, each have a CLI tool for installing their respective project. I get the reasons why; you can build logic into a CLI tool that you can&amp;rsquo;t build into a YAML file. &lt;a href=&#34;https://kuma.io&#34;&gt;Kuma&lt;/a&gt;, the open source service mesh maintained largely by Kong and a CNCF Sandbox project, takes a similar approach with its &lt;code&gt;kumactl&lt;/code&gt; tool. In this post, however, I&amp;rsquo;d like to take a look at creating reusable YAML to install Kuma, instead of using the CLI tool every time you install.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
