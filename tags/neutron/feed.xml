      <description>&lt;p&gt;This session was titled &amp;ldquo;Carrier-Grade SDN Based OpenStack Networking Solution,&amp;rdquo; led by Daniel Park and Sangho Shin. Both Park and Shin are from SK Telecom (SKT), and (based on the description) this session is a follow-up to a session from the Boston summit where SK Telecom talked about an SDN-based networking solution they&amp;rsquo;d developed and released for use in their own 5G-based network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a liveblog of the OpenStack Summit Sydney session titled &amp;ldquo;IPv6 Primer for Deployments&amp;rdquo;, led by Trent Lloyd from Canonical. IPv6 is a topic with which I know I need to get more familiar, so attending this session seemed like a reasonable approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This is part 18 of the Learning NSX blog series, in which I talk about using layer 3 (L3) routing with VMware NSX but without network address translation (NAT). This post describes a configuration that offers yet another connectivity option for OpenStack cloud administrators and operators.
In part 6, I showed you how to add a gateway appliance to your NSX installation. Part 9 leveraged the gateway appliances to create a L3 gateway service, which&amp;mdash;as I explained in part 15&amp;mdash;provides the functionality for logical routers in OpenStack.</description>

      <description>This is part 17 of the Learning NSX blog series. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to add layer 2 (L2) connectivity to your NSX environment, and how to leverage that L2 connectivity in an NSX-powered OpenStack implementation. This will allow you, as an operator of an NSX-powered OpenStack cloud, to offer L2/bridged connectivity to your tenants as an additional option.
As you might expect, this post does build on content from previous posts in the series.</description>

      <title>Learning NSX, Part 16: Routing to Multiple External VLANs</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2014/10/13/learning-nsx-part-16-routing-to-multiple-external-vlans/</link>

      <description>This is part 16 of the Learning NSX series, in which I will show you how to configure VMware NSX to route to multiple external VLANs. This configuration will allow you to have logical routers that could be uplinked to any of the external VLANs, providing additional flexibility for consumers of NSX logical networks.
Naturally, this post builds on all the previous entries in this series, so I encourage you to visit the Learning NVP/NSX page for links to previous posts.</description>

      <description>This is part 15 of my Learning NSX blog series, in which I will spend some time diving a bit deeper into some of the components involved in the logical routing process I described in part 14. Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking a deeper look at gateway appliances, gateway services, and logical routers, and the relationships among these various components.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read any of the prior posts in this series, it would be ideal to read all of them before continuing; you can find links on my Learning NVP/NSX page.</description>

      <description>Welcome to part 14 of the Learning NSX blog series, in which I discuss the ability for VMware NSX to do Layer 3 routing in logical networks. This post will also include a look at a very cool feature within VMware NSX known as distributed logical routing. This post will take a closer look at distributed logical routing within the context of an OpenStack environment that&amp;rsquo;s been integrated with VMware NSX.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Technology Short Take #42, another installation in my ongoing series of irregularly published collections of news, items, thoughts, rants, raves, and tidbits from around the Internet, with a focus on data center-related technologies. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping you find something useful!
Networking   Anthony Burke&amp;rsquo;s series on VMware NSX continues with part 5.
  Aaron Rosen, a Neutron contributor, recently published a post about a Neutron extension called Allowed-Address-Pairs and how you can use it to create high availability instances using VRRP (via keepalived).</description>

      <description>Welcome to part 13 of the Learning NSX blog series, in which I revisit the idea of logical networking with VMware NSX. This is a topic I first discussed in part 5 of this series, but I want to go back and look at it again, this time from a more practical perspective of what it looks like to use VMware NSX for logical networking in an OpenStack environment.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t been keeping up with the Learning NVP/NSX series, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to go back and catch up.</description>

      <description>Welcome to part 12 of the Learning NSX blog series, in which I continue the discussion around integration between OpenStack and VMware NSX, and in which I&amp;rsquo;ll provide more details about how exactly to integrate them.
If you are just now joining the series, I encourage you to visit the Learning NVP/NSX page, where you can find links to all the posts in the series. While you&amp;rsquo;ll want to be caught up on all the posts (they do build on one another in various ways), in particular you&amp;rsquo;ll want to make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve read part 11.</description>

      <description>Welcome to part 11 of the Learning NSX blog series, in which I provide a high-level overview of the basics on integrating VMware NSX into an OpenStack deployment using OpenStack Neutron. In case you&amp;rsquo;re just now catching up on this blog series, I encourage you to visit my Learning NVP/NSX page, which has a brief summary of all the posts in the series.
Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve shown you how to build all the different components of NSX (NSX controllers, NSX Manager, gateway appliances, and service nodes), it&amp;rsquo;s time to add integration into a cloud management platform.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Technology Short Take #39, in which I share a random assortment of links, articles, and thoughts from around the world of data center-related technologies. I hope you find something useful&amp;mdash;or at least something interesting!
Networking   Jason Edelman has been talking about the idea of a Common Programmable Abstraction Layer (CPAL). He introduces the idea, then goes on to explore&amp;mdash;as he puts it&amp;mdash;the power of a CPAL. I can&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if this is the right level at which to put the abstraction layer.</description>

      <description>Welcome to part 10 of the Learning NSX blog series, in which I will walk through adding an NSX service node to your NSX configuration.
In the event you&amp;rsquo;ve joined this series mid-way, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve covered thus far:
  In part 1, I provided a high-level overview of NVP/NSX and its core components.
  In part 2, I showed you how to build NVP/NSX controllers and configure them into a controller cluster.</description>
