      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #151, the first Technology Short Take of 2022. I hope everyone had a great holiday season and that 2022 is off to a wonderful start! I have a few more links than normal this time around, although I didn&amp;rsquo;t find articles in a couple categories. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;ll keep my eyes peeled and my RSS reader ready to pull in new articles in those categories for next time. And now for the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #150! This is the last Technology Short Take of 2021, so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll close the year out &amp;ldquo;with a bang&amp;rdquo; with this collection of links and articles on various technology areas. Bring on the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review: OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2021/12/23/review-owc-thunderbolt-dock/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2021/12/23/review-owc-thunderbolt-dock/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About six months ago I purchased an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbolt-3-dock-14-port&#34;&gt;OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock&lt;/a&gt; to replace my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anker.com/a8396launch&#34;&gt;Anker PowerElite Thunderbolt 3 Dock&lt;/a&gt; (see my review &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2020/07/24/review-anker-powerexpand-elite-thunderbolt-3-dock/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). While there was nothing necessarily wrong with the Anker PowerElite, it lacked a digital audio port that I could use to send audio to a soundbar positioned under my monitor. (I&amp;rsquo;d grown accustomed to using a soundbar when my 2012 Mac Pro was my primary workstation.) In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide a brief review of the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #148, aka the Thanksgiving Edition (at least, for US readers). I&amp;rsquo;ve been scouring RSS feeds and various social media sites, collecting as many useful links and articles as I can find: from networking hardware and networking CI/CD pipelines to Kernel TLS and tricks for improving your working memory. That&amp;rsquo;s quite the range! I hope that you find something useful here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #147! The list of articles is a bit shorter than usual this time around, but I&amp;rsquo;ve still got a good collection of articles and posts covering topics in networking, hardware (mostly focused on Apple&amp;rsquo;s processors), cloud computing, and virtualization. There&amp;rsquo;s bound to be something in here for most everyone! (At least, I hope so.) Enjoy your weekend reading!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #144! I have a fairly diverse set of links for readers this time around, covering topics from microchips to improving your writing, with stops along the way in topics like Kubernetes, virtualization, Linux, and the popular JSON-parsing tool &lt;code&gt;jq&lt;/code&gt;. I hope you find something useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #141! This is the first Technology Short Take compiled, written, and published entirely on my M1-based MacBook Pro (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2021/06/02/review-2020-m1-based-macbook-pro/&#34;&gt;my review here&lt;/a&gt;). The collection of links shared below covers a fairly wide range of topics, from old Sun hardware to working with serverless frameworks in the public cloud. I hope that you find something useful here. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review: 2020 M1-Based MacBook Pro</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done a personal hardware refresh in a while; my laptop was a 2017-era MacBook Pro (with the much-disliked butterfly keyboard) and my tablet was a 2014-era iPad Air 2. Both were serviceable but starting to show their age, especially with regard to battery life. So, a little under a month ago, I placed an order for some new Apple equipment. Included in that order was a new 2020 13&amp;quot; MacBook Pro with the Apple-designed M1 CPU. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to provide a brief review of the 2020 M1-based MacBook Pro based on the past month of usage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #138. I have what I hope is an interesting and useful set of links to share with everyone this time around. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do so well on storage links; apologies to my storage-focused friends! However, there should be something for most everyone else. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #136, the first Short Take of 2021! The content this time around seems to be a bit more security-focused, but I&amp;rsquo;ve still managed to include a few links in other areas. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping you find something useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review: CPLAY2air Wireless CarPlay Adapter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In late September, I was given a CPLAY2air wireless CarPlay adapter as a gift. Neither of my vehicles support wireless CarPlay, and so I was looking forward to using the CPLAY2air device to enable the use of CarPlay without having to have my phone plugged into a cable. Here&amp;rsquo;s my feedback on the CPLAY2air device after about six weeks of use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #132! My list of links and articles from around the web seems to be a bit heavy on security-related topics this time. Still, there&amp;rsquo;s a decent collection of networking, cloud computing, and virtualization articles as well as a smattering of other topics for you to peruse. I hope you find something useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of weeks or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using my 2017 MacBook Pro (running macOS &amp;ldquo;Mojave&amp;rdquo; 10.14.6) more frequently as my daily driver/primary workstation. Along with it, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powerexpand-elite-13in1-thunderbolt-3-dock/A8396141&#34;&gt;the Anker PowerExpand Elite 13-in-1 Thunderbolt 3 Dock&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my experience with this dock and provide a quick review of the Anker PowerExpand Elite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
