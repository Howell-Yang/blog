      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #155, just in time for the 2022 Memorial Day holiday weekend! (Here in the US, at least.) I mean, don&amp;rsquo;t you want to spend this weekend catching up on some technology-related articles instead of cooking on the grill and gathering with friends and family? I certainly hope not! Still, for those who need a little technology fix over the weekend, hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ve included something useful in the list of articles below. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #152! Normally I&amp;rsquo;d publish a Technology Short Take in the morning on a Friday, but I really wanted to get this one out so I&amp;rsquo;m making it live late in the day on a Monday. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping I&amp;rsquo;ve included some content below that you find useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #147! The list of articles is a bit shorter than usual this time around, but I&amp;rsquo;ve still got a good collection of articles and posts covering topics in networking, hardware (mostly focused on Apple&amp;rsquo;s processors), cloud computing, and virtualization. There&amp;rsquo;s bound to be something in here for most everyone! (At least, I hope so.) Enjoy your weekend reading!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Considerations for using IaC with Cluster API</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/10/08/considerations-for-using-iac-with-cluster-api/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In other posts on this site, I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about both infrastructure-as-code (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/tags/terraform&#34;&gt;my posts on Terraform&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/tags/pulumi&#34;&gt;my posts on Pulumi&lt;/a&gt;) and somewhat separately I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about Cluster API (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/tags/capi&#34;&gt;my posts on Cluster API&lt;/a&gt;). And while I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed the idea of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2019/09/09/consuming-preexisting-aws-infrastructure-with-cluster-api/&#34;&gt;using existing AWS infrastructure with Cluster API&lt;/a&gt;, in this post I wanted to try to think about how these two technologies play together, and provide some considerations for using them together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #126! I meant to get this published last Friday, but completely forgot. So, I added a couple more links and instead have it ready for you today. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any links for servers/hardware or security in today&amp;rsquo;s Short Take, but hopefully there&amp;rsquo;s enough linked content in the other sections that you&amp;rsquo;ll still find something useful. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #122! Luckily I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; manage to get another Tech Short Take squeezed in for 2019, just so all my readers could have some reading materials for the holidays. I&amp;rsquo;m kidding! No, I mean I really am kidding&amp;mdash;don&amp;rsquo;t read stuff over the holidays. Spend time with your family instead. The investment in your family will pay off in later years, trust me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #121! This may possibly be the last Tech Short Take of 2019 (not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to squeeze in another one), so here&amp;rsquo;s hoping that you find something useful, helpful, or informative in the links that I&amp;rsquo;ve collected. Enjoy some light reading over your festive holiday season!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #120! Wow&amp;hellip;hard to believe it&amp;rsquo;s been almost two months since the last Tech Short Take. Sorry about that! Hopefully something I share here in this Tech Short Take is useful or helpful to readers. On to the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #119! As usual, I&amp;rsquo;ve collected some articles and links from around the Internet pertaining to various data center- and cloud-related topics. This installation in the Tech Short Takes series is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; shorter than usual, but hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to find something that proves to be helpful or informative! Now, on to the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Consuming Pre-Existing AWS Infrastructure with Cluster API</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2019/09/09/consuming-preexisting-aws-infrastructure-with-cluster-api/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All the posts I&amp;rsquo;ve published so far about &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api&#34;&gt;Cluster API (CAPI)&lt;/a&gt; assume that the underlying infrastructure needs to be created. This is fine, because generally speaking that&amp;rsquo;s part of the value of CAPI&amp;mdash;it will create new cloud infrastructure for every Kubernetes cluster it instantiates. In the case of AWS, this includes VPCs, subnets, route tables, Internet gateways, NAT gateways, Elastic IPs, security groups, load balancers, and (of course) EC2 instances. But what if you &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; want CAPA to create AWS infrastructure? In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to consume pre-existing AWS infrastructure with Cluster API for AWS (CAPA).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #115! I&amp;rsquo;m back from my much-needed vacation in Bali, and getting settled back into work and my daily routine (which, for the last few weeks, was mostly swimming in the pool and sitting on the beach). Here&amp;rsquo;s a fresh new collection of links and articles from the around the web to propel myself back into blogging. I hope you find something useful here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #111! I&amp;rsquo;m a couple weeks late on this one; wanted to publish it earlier but work has been keeping me busy (lots and lots of interest in Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies out there!). In any event, here you are&amp;mdash;I hope you find something useful for you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #109! This is the first Technology Short Take of 2019. It may be confirmation bias, but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed of number of sites adding &amp;ldquo;Short Take&amp;rdquo;-type posts to their content lineup. I&amp;rsquo;ll take that as flattery, even if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily intended that way. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
