      <description>Some time ago I posted a &amp;ldquo;how to&amp;rdquo; article on how to configure FCoE on a Nexus 5000 switch. At that time, I did not put the Nexus 5000 into NPV mode but rather connected it to a Cisco MDS Fibre Channel switch without using NPV. In this entry, I&amp;rsquo;d like to follow up on that article and show you how to configure NPV on a Nexus 5000.
If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with NPV (N_Port Virtualization) and how it&amp;rsquo;s different than NPIV (N_Port ID Virtualization), check out this article titled &amp;ldquo;Understanding NPIV and NPV&amp;rdquo;; It should help clear things up.</description>

      <description>Two technologies that seem to have come to the fore recently are NPIV (N_Port ID Virtualization) and NPV (N_Port Virtualization). Judging just by the names, you might think that these two technologies are the same thing. While they are related in some aspects and can be used in a complementary way, they are quite different. What I&amp;rsquo;d like to do in this post is help explain these two technologies, how they are different, and how they can be used.</description>
