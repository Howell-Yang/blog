      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the holiday break I made some time to work on my desk layout, something I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to do for quite a while. I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to &amp;ldquo;up my game,&amp;rdquo; so to speak, with regard to producing more content, including some video content. Inspired by&amp;mdash;and heavily borrowing from&amp;mdash;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WedG8LKO6ks&#34;&gt;this YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;, I decided I wanted to create a similar arrangement for my desk. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share more details on my setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Almost six years ago I shared my (then) current Getting Things Done (GTD) setup, in which I described how I used various tools, techniques, and applications to try to maximize my productivity. I&amp;rsquo;d been toying with updating that post, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure that anyone would find it useful. However, a recent e-mail from a reader indicated that there probably is some interest; with that in mind, then, here&amp;rsquo;s an update on my GTD-like setup, circa early 2016.</description>
