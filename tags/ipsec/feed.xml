      <title>Split Tunneling with vpnc</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vpnc&lt;/code&gt; is a fairly well-known VPN connectivity package available for most Linux distributions. Although &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/%7Emassar/vpnc/&#34;&gt;the &lt;code&gt;vpnc&lt;/code&gt; web site&lt;/a&gt; describes it as a client for the Cisco VPN Concentrator, it works with a wide variety of IPSec VPN solutions. I&amp;rsquo;m using it to connect to a Palo Alto Networks-based solution, for example. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share how to set up split tunneling for &lt;code&gt;vpnc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Following on the heels of this week&amp;rsquo;s VMware NSX announcement at VMworld 2013, I had someone contact me about a statement this person had heard. The statement claimed NSX was nothing more than a collection of tools, and that it was possible to get the equivalent of NSX using completely free (as in speech and as in beer) open source tools&amp;mdash;specifically, IPTables, StrongSwan, OpenVPN, and Open vSwitch (OVS). Basically, the statement was that it was possible to create do-it-yourself network virtualization.</description>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve been searching for a good way to establish connectivity to the lab at my office for a while. My first attempt was to work with one of our CCIEs at the office to establish an IPSec-based VPN against a Cisco router at the edge of the lab network, but despite our best efforts we couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the IPSec VPN client I was using, IPSecuritas, to connect and authenticate. No amount of fiddling would make it work.</description>

      <title>Application-Specific VPNs</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2005/12/13/application-specific-vpns/</link>

      <description>I coined the term &amp;ldquo;application specific VPNs&amp;rdquo; as I began exploring the many uses of tools such as SSH (the OpenSSH implementation, in particular) and Stunnel (the open source SSL wrapper). An &amp;ldquo;application specific VPN&amp;rdquo; is a technique for employing encrypted communication with a particular remote application that does not affect the operation of other applications (local or remote) on the system.
In general, most VPNs employ technology such as PPTP or IPSec.</description>

      <title>Cisco PIX VPN and Active Directory Integration</title>

      <description>Rather than publishing this information in PDF form on my business website, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try something new and post it here as a blog entry. So, here goes.
This information assumes that you have some experience with the Cisco PIX firewall (i.e., you know how to enter configuration commands and have a basic idea of what the configuration commands actually do) as well as some experience with Windows and Active Directory.</description>

      <title>IPSec, Mac OS X, and Windows Server 2003</title>

      <description>For quite some time now, a minor task I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with is establishing transport mode IPSec security associations between Mac OS X and Windows Server 2003. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a freeware IPSec client called IPSecuritas. Up until just a few days ago, I could never get anything to work. After working on getting a PPTP-based VPN working from my PowerBook, I realized that just as I had to modify my ipfw rules (using BrickHouse) to allow the PPTP traffic, I&amp;rsquo;d have to modify the rules to allow IPSec traffic as well.</description>
