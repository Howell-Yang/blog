      <title>Follow Up: Bootstrapping Servers into Ansible</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, I wrote a quick post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2015/05/26/bootstrap-servers-ansible/&#34;&gt;bootstrapping servers into Ansible&lt;/a&gt;. The basic gist of the post was that you can use variables on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; command-line to specify hosts that aren&amp;rsquo;t part of your inventory or log in via a different user (useful if the host doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet have a dedicated Ansible user account because you want to use Ansible to create that account). Recently, though, I encountered a situation where this approach doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, and in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe the workaround.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #140! It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe it&amp;rsquo;s already the start of May 2021&amp;mdash;my how time flies! In this Technology Short Take, I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered some links for you covering topics like Azure and AWS networking, moving from macOS to Linux (and back again), and more. Let&amp;rsquo;s jump right into the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Making it Easier to Get Started with Cluster API on AWS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written a few articles about &lt;a href=&#34;https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/introduction.html&#34;&gt;Cluster API&lt;/a&gt; (you can see a list of the articles &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/tags/capi/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but even though I strive to make my articles easy to understand and easy to follow along many of those articles make an implicit assumption: that readers are perhaps already somewhat familiar with Linux, Docker, tools like &lt;code&gt;kind&lt;/code&gt;, and perhaps even Kubernetes. Today I was thinking, &amp;ldquo;What about folks who are new to this? What can I do to make it easier?&amp;rdquo; In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the first idea I had: creating a &amp;ldquo;bootstrapper&amp;rdquo; AMI that enables new users to quickly and easily jump into &lt;a href=&#34;https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/quick-start.html&#34;&gt;the Cluster API Quick Start&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #119! As usual, I&amp;rsquo;ve collected some articles and links from around the Internet pertaining to various data center- and cloud-related topics. This installation in the Tech Short Takes series is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; shorter than usual, but hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to find something that proves to be helpful or informative! Now, on to the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #117! Here&amp;rsquo;s my latest gathering of links and articles from the around the World Wide Web (an &amp;ldquo;old school&amp;rdquo; reference for you right there). I&amp;rsquo;ve got a little bit of something for most everyone, except for the storage nerds (I&amp;rsquo;m leaving that to my friend J Metz this time around). Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping you find something useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Calculating the CA Certificate Hash for Kubeadm</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2019/07/12/calculating-ca-certificate-hash-for-kubeadm/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2019/07/12/calculating-ca-certificate-hash-for-kubeadm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When using &lt;code&gt;kubeadm&lt;/code&gt; to set up a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; cluster, the output of the &lt;code&gt;kubeadm init&lt;/code&gt; command that sets up the control plane for the first time contains some important information on joining additional nodes to the cluster. One piece of information in there that (until now) I hadn&amp;rsquo;t figured out how to replicate was the CA certificate hash. (Primarily I hadn&amp;rsquo;t figured it out because I hadn&amp;rsquo;t tried.) In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share how to calculate the CA certificate hash for &lt;code&gt;kubeadm&lt;/code&gt; to use when joining additional nodes to an existing cluster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #115!

Here&amp;rsquo;s a fresh new collection of links and articles from the around the web to propel myself back into blogging. I hope you find something useful here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Additive Loops with Ansible and Jinja2</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2018/07/16/additive-loops-with-ansible-jinja2/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2018/07/16/additive-loops-with-ansible-jinja2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if &amp;ldquo;additive&amp;rdquo; is the right word, but it was the best word I could come up with to describe the sort of configuration I recently needed to address in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;. In retrospect, the solution seems pretty straightforward, but I&amp;rsquo;ll include it here just in case it proves useful to someone else. If nothing else, it will at least show some interesting things that can be done with Ansible and Jinja2 templates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take 102! I normally try to get these things published biweekly (every other Friday), but this one has taken quite a bit longer to get published. It&amp;rsquo;s no one&amp;rsquo;s fault but my own! In any event, I hope that you&amp;rsquo;re able to find something useful among the links below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Time really flies when you&amp;rsquo;re having fun! Anyway, here is Technology Short Take 100&amp;hellip;I hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
