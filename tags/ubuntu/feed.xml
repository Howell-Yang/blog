      <title>Follow Up: Bootstrapping Servers into Ansible</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, I wrote a quick post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2015/05/26/bootstrap-servers-ansible/&#34;&gt;bootstrapping servers into Ansible&lt;/a&gt;. The basic gist of the post was that you can use variables on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; command-line to specify hosts that aren&amp;rsquo;t part of your inventory or log in via a different user (useful if the host doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet have a dedicated Ansible user account because you want to use Ansible to create that account). Recently, though, I encountered a situation where this approach doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, and in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe the workaround.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #145! What will you find in this Tech Short Take? Well, let&amp;rsquo;s see&amp;hellip;stuff on Envoy, network automation, network designs, M1 chips (and potential open source variants!), a bevy of security articles (including a couple on very severe vulnerabilities), Kubernetes, AWS IAM, and so much more! I hope that you find something useful here. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #126! I meant to get this published last Friday, but completely forgot. So, I added a couple more links and instead have it ready for you today. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any links for servers/hardware or security in today&amp;rsquo;s Short Take, but hopefully there&amp;rsquo;s enough linked content in the other sections that you&amp;rsquo;ll still find something useful. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Making File URLs Work Again in Firefox</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/04/04/making-file-urls-work-again-in-firefox/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/04/04/making-file-urls-work-again-in-firefox/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At some point in the last year or so&amp;mdash;I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly when it happened&amp;mdash;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, along with most of the other major browsers, stopped working with &lt;code&gt;file://&lt;/code&gt; URLs. This is a shame, because I like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2017/03/07/linux-migration-creating-presentations/&#34;&gt;using Markdown for presentations&lt;/a&gt; (at least, when it&amp;rsquo;s a presentation where I don&amp;rsquo;t need to collaborate with others). However, using this sort of approach generally requires support for &lt;code&gt;file://&lt;/code&gt; URLs (or requires running a local web server). In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to make &lt;code&gt;file://&lt;/code&gt; URLs work again in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; is a core part of many of my workflows. For quite a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve used Fletcher Penny&amp;rsquo;s MultiMarkdown processor (available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-6/&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;) on my various systems. Fletcher offers binary builds for Windows and macOS, but not a Linux binary. Three years ago, I wrote a post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2017/11/25/installing-mmd6-on-fedora-27/&#34;&gt;how to compile MultiMarkdown 6 for a Fedora-based system&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share how to compile it on an Ubuntu-based system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #107! In response to my request for feedback in the last Technology Short Take, a few readers responded in favor of a more regular publication schedule even if that means the articles are shorter in length. Thus, this Tech Short Take may be a bit shorter than usual, but hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll still find something useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month&amp;mdash;May 2018&amp;mdash;marks &lt;strong&gt;thirteen years&lt;/strong&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ve been generating content here on this site. It&amp;rsquo;s been a phenomenal 13 years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed the opportunity to share information with readers around the world. To celebrate, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do a quick &amp;ldquo;Posts from the Past&amp;rdquo; and highlight some content from previous years. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take 95! This Short Take was a bit more challenging than normal to compile, given that I spent the week leading up to its publication visiting customers in Europe. (My travel schedule in Europe is also why it didn&amp;rsquo;t get published until Saturday instead of the typical Friday.) Nevertheless, I have persevered in order to deliver you this list of links and articles. I hope it proves useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written about using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/products/docker-machine&#34;&gt;Docker Machine&lt;/a&gt; with a number of different providers, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2016/03/22/using-docker-machine-with-aws/&#34;&gt;with AWS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2015/09/24/using-docker-machine-with-openstack/&#34;&gt;with OpenStack&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2017/11/24/using-docker-machine-kvm-libvirt/&#34;&gt;with a local KVM/Libvirt daemon&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll expand that series to show using Docker Machine with Azure. (This is a follow-up to my earlier post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2018/01/16/experimenting-with-azure/&#34;&gt;experimenting with Azure&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After over 12 years of writing here, I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated a pretty fair amount of content. To help folks discover older content, I thought it might be fun to revisit what I&amp;rsquo;ve published in October in years past. Here are some &amp;ldquo;posts from the past,&amp;rdquo; all from October of previous years. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #87! I have a mix of newer and older items for you this time around. While I&amp;rsquo;m a bit short on links in some areas, hopefully this is outweighed by some good content in other areas. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping you find something useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Linux Migration: Corporate Collaboration, Part 3</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2017/04/03/linux-migration-corp-collab-pt3/</link>

      <description>In discussing support for corporate communication and collaboration systems as part of my Linux migration, I&amp;rsquo;ve so far covered e-mail in part 1 and calendaring in part 2. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to discuss the last few remaining aspects of corporate collaboration: instant messaging/chat, meetings and teleconferences, and document sharing.
Teleconferences and meetings The topic of teleconferences and meetings is closely related to calendaring&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s often necessary to access your calendar or others&amp;rsquo; calendars when coordinating meetings or teleconferences&amp;mdash;so I encourage you to read part 2 to get a better feel for the challenges around calendaring/scheduling.</description>

      <title>The Linux Migration: Other Users&#39; Stories, Part 4</title>

      <description>This post is part of a series of posts sharing other users&amp;rsquo; stories about their migration to Linux as their primary desktop OS. As I mentioned in part 1 of the series, there seemed to be quite a bit of pent-up interest in using Linux as your primary desktop OS. I thought it might be helpful to readers to hear not just about my migration, but also about others&amp;rsquo; migrations. You may also find it interesting/helpful to read part 2 and part 3 of this series for more migration stories.</description>
