      <description>One of my projects over the Christmas holiday has been to rebuild the home network. You&amp;rsquo;d think I&amp;rsquo;d want to avoid that sort of thing since I&amp;rsquo;ve been on vacation from work for the past two weeks, but working on a home network is a different sort of beast than working on a network for a company. There are different challenges to be addressed.
My primary goals for this &amp;ldquo;home network rebuild&amp;rdquo; were the following:</description>

      <description>Since I had CentOS 5 up and running on ESX Server in the test lab, I decided to try to validate my latest Linux-AD integration instructions on this installation. Unfortunately, the instructions do not seem to work well at all with CentOS 5; here are some of the errors that I ran into:
Existing Kerberos Tickets Not Recognized When using net ads join to join the Active Directory domain, it didn&amp;rsquo;t recognize any existing Kerberos tickets.</description>

      <title>Some Notes on Solaris-AD Integration</title>

      <description>This afternoon, I walked back through my own instructions for integrating Solaris 10 and Active Directory, and I found that the process wasn&amp;rsquo;t as smooth as perhaps I&amp;rsquo;d believed it to be. As a result of walking back through the process again myself, I&amp;rsquo;ve collected some notes. At some point in the near future, these notes will be integrated into a new version of the Solaris-AD integration instructions.
So, without further ado, here are the notes I collected in no particular order:</description>

      <title>Linux-AD Integration with Windows Server 2008</title>

      <description>In the event that your organization is considering a migration later this year (or next?) to Windows Server 2008 (formerly &amp;ldquo;Longhorn&amp;rdquo;), here are some instructions for integrating Linux login requests against Active Directory on Windows Server 2008. These instructions are based on Linux-AD Integration, Version 4 and utilize Kerberos, LDAP, and Samba.
When this process is complete, AD users can be enabled for use on Linux systems on the network and login to those Linux systems using the same username and password as throughout the rest of Active Directory.</description>

      <description>Samba, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure you already know, is an open source implementation of SMB/CIFS for UNIX, Linux, and similar operating systems. I&amp;rsquo;ve found Samba to be extremely helpful in providing some assistance for integration into Active Directory, as evidenced by these articles:
Solaris 10-AD Integration, Version 3
Linux-AD Integration, Version 4
Both of these articles utilize Samba&amp;rsquo;s Active Directory support to help automate the process of joining non-Windows systems to Active Directory for the purpose of authenticating logon requests against Active Directory.</description>

      <title>Solaris-AD Integration Update Coming</title>

      <description>The last update to the Solaris 10-Active Directory integration instructions was in October of last year, over six months ago. Since that time, Sun has released another update to Solaris (Solaris 10 11/06, or Update 3) and I have been able to gather some additional information on using an Active Directory-aware version of Samba to help with the process (much like described in the latest version of the Linux-AD instructions).</description>

      <title>Samba in Solaris-AD Integration</title>

      <description>Using Samba in Linux-AD integration scenarios is tremendously helpful because it removes the need to manually create the SPNs and export the keytabs out of Active Directory. I wrote up my first test of Samba in Linux-AD integration, then proceeded to verify that procedure and include it in the full Linux-AD integration instructions. But would it work in Solaris-AD integration scenarios?
In theory, yes. After all, Samba is included with Solaris 10, right?</description>

      <title>Mounting SMB Shares in Linux</title>

      <description>This is one of those commands that you need to know, but use it so very rarely that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to memorize. It seems like I have to go back and look this up every time I need to use it. What is it? It&amp;rsquo;s the command to mount an SMB share from the typical Linux host.
The command looks something like this:
mount -t smbfs -o username=User,password=Pass //host.IP.addr.ess/sharename /local/mnt  Of course, this should be typed all on a single line.</description>

      <title>SLED Integration into Active Directory</title>

      <description>The information below comes from site reader Shannon VanWagner, who had the time to research this and come back with the information necessary to integrate SuSE Linux Enterprise Desktop (SLED) 10 into Active Directory (on Windows Server 2003 R2) using Kerberos, LDAP, and Samba. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested these instructions (no copy of SLED with which to test), but I imagine that they should be fine. It&amp;rsquo;s really just the SLED-specific tweaks to the existing AD integration instructions, anyway.</description>

      <title>Linux-AD Integration, Version 4</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2007/01/15/linux-ad-integration-version-4/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2007/01/15/linux-ad-integration-version-4/</guid>
      <description>This procedure allows Linux-based systems to authenticate against Active Directory. This configuration uses Kerberos for authentication, LDAP for account information, and Samba to help automate the process along the way. When this process is complete, AD users can be enabled for use on Linux systems on the network and login to those Linux systems using the same username and password as throughout the rest of Active Directory.
These instructions are designed for use with Windows Server 2003 R2.</description>

      <description>To help make it easier to find the various Active Directory integration articles I&amp;rsquo;ve written, I&amp;rsquo;m including links below to the latest version of each article. As new versions of an article are published, I can simply update this link to point to the new version.
I&amp;rsquo;ve grouped the integration articles according to product below.

      <description>With the holidays and all, a few articles that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for a while have been delayed. However, to assure you that more original content is on the way, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick look at some of the articles that I hope to have published here within the next couple of weeks:
  More information on using Network Appliance Snapshots to recover virtual machines: I published an article on using Snapshots to recover individual files from VMs, but I also want to look at recovering entire VMs using NetApp&amp;rsquo;s snapshot functionality.</description>

      <description>Suggestions to use Samba in Linux-AD integration scenarios appeared in the comments for the following articles:
Linux, Active Directory, and Windows Server 2003 R2 Revisited
Kerberos-Based SSO with Apache
The idea was that Samba could be used to help automate the process of creating the appropriate service principals in Active Directory. Previously, I had recommended the use of ktpass.exe and separate user accounts for each service principal (i.e., HOST/ or host/, HTTP/, etc.</description>
