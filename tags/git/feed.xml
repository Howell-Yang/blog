      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started migrating many of the applications on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://getfedora.org/&#34;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; 36 laptop to their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flatpak.org/&#34;&gt;Flatpak&lt;/a&gt; versions. For the most part, this has been pretty straightforward, although there isn&amp;rsquo;t really any method for migrating configuration and data. Today I ran into a problem with &lt;a href=&#34;https://meldmerge.org/&#34;&gt;Meld&lt;/a&gt;, a graphical diff utility, and using it with the &lt;code&gt;git difftool&lt;/code&gt; command. Below I&amp;rsquo;ll share how I worked around this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #154! My link of links and articles from around the Internet is a bit light on networking and virtualization this time around, but heftier in the security, cloud, and OS/application sections. I hope that I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to include something that you&amp;rsquo;ll find useful. Enjoy the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #153! My personal and professional life has kept me busy over the last couple of months, so things have been quiet here on the blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve still been collecting links to share with you, though, and here&amp;rsquo;s the latest collection. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re able to find something useful here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #151, the first Technology Short Take of 2022. I hope everyone had a great holiday season and that 2022 is off to a wonderful start! I have a few more links than normal this time around, although I didn&amp;rsquo;t find articles in a couple categories. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;ll keep my eyes peeled and my RSS reader ready to pull in new articles in those categories for next time. And now for the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #142! This time around, the Networking section is a bit light, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got plenty of cloud computing links and articles for you to enjoy, along with some stuff on OSes and applications, programming, and soft skills. Hopefully there&amp;rsquo;s something useful here for you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #141! This is the first Technology Short Take compiled, written, and published entirely on my M1-based MacBook Pro (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2021/06/02/review-2020-m1-based-macbook-pro/&#34;&gt;my review here&lt;/a&gt;). The collection of links shared below covers a fairly wide range of topics, from old Sun hardware to working with serverless frameworks in the public cloud. I hope that you find something useful here. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #139! This Technology Short Take is a bit heavy on cloud, OS, and programming topics, but there should be enough other interesting links to be useful to plenty of folks. (At least, I hope that&amp;rsquo;s the case!) Now, let&amp;rsquo;s get on to the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #131! I&amp;rsquo;m back with another collection of articles on various data center technologies.

Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping you find something useful here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #130! I&amp;rsquo;ve had this blog post sitting in my Drafts folder waiting to be published for almost a month, and I kept forgetting to actually make it live. Sorry! So, here it is&amp;mdash;better late than never, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #128! It looks like I&amp;rsquo;m settling into a roughly monthly cadence with the Technology Short Takes. This time around, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a (hopefully) interesting collection of links. The collection seems a tad heavier than normal in the hardware and security sections, probably due to new exploits discovered in Intel&amp;rsquo;s speculative execution functionality. In any case, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered for you. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #109! This is the first Technology Short Take of 2019. It may be confirmation bias, but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed of number of sites adding &amp;ldquo;Short Take&amp;rdquo;-type posts to their content lineup. I&amp;rsquo;ll take that as flattery, even if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily intended that way. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bolstering my Software Development Skills</title>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2018/07/23/bolstering-my-software-development-skills/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/scott_lowe/status/1019743197105229824&#34;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that I was about to undertake a new pet project where I was, in my words, &amp;ldquo;probably going to fall flat on my face&amp;rdquo;. Later, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/scott_lowe/status/1020776898870181888&#34;&gt;I asked on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; if I should share some of the learning that will occur (is ocurring) as a result of this new project, and a number of folks indicated that I should. So, with that in mind, I&amp;rsquo;m announcing this project I&amp;rsquo;ve undertaken is a software development project aimed at helping me bolster my software development skills, and that I&amp;rsquo;ll be blogging about it along the way so that others can benefit from my mistakes&amp;hellip;er, learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
