      <description>Quickly following the initial beta release of Virtualization Manager Mobile (VMM), Schley Andrew Kutz has now released beta 1.5 of VMM. The updated beta, available via the relaunched lostcreations.com site, boasts several new features:
  In addition to support for VMware Infrastructure 3 and VMware Server 2, VMM now supports Citrix XenServer 5.
  VMM will now &amp;ldquo;gracefully degrade&amp;rdquo; on mobile devices that don&amp;rsquo;t have a fully AJAX-capable browser.</description>

      <description>Funambol, formerly Sync4j, is claiming that its latest product, Funambol 3, could function as an open-source Blackberry workaround, allowing push e-mail to be delivered to a variety of mobile devices, including Blackberries. This is particularly important in light of the threat of a Blackberry shutdown due to the RIM-NTP patent dispute.
Currently in beta, the v3 server software runs on Linux or Windows, and clients are available for Outlook, Windows Mobile, Blackberry, Palm, and (believe it or not) iPod.</description>
