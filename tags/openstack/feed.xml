      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month&amp;mdash;May 2018&amp;mdash;marks &lt;strong&gt;thirteen years&lt;/strong&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ve been generating content here on this site. It&amp;rsquo;s been a phenomenal 13 years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed the opportunity to share information with readers around the world. To celebrate, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do a quick &amp;ldquo;Posts from the Past&amp;rdquo; and highlight some content from previous years. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take 92, the first Technology Short Take of 2018. This one was &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be the last Tech Short Take of 2017, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get it published in time (I decided to spend time with my family instead&amp;mdash;some things are just more important). In any case, hopefully the delay of one additional week hasn&amp;rsquo;t caused any undue stress&amp;mdash;let&amp;rsquo;s jump right in!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take 91! It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit longer than usual since the last Tech Short Take (partly due to the US Thanksgiving holiday, partly due to vacation time, and partly due to business travel), so apologies for that. Still, there&amp;rsquo;s a great collection of links and articles here for you, so dig in and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
