      <title>The Next Step</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Greek philosopher Heraclitus is typically attributed as the creator of the well-known phrase &amp;ldquo;Change is the only constant.&amp;rdquo; Since I left VMware in 2018 to join Heptio, change has been my companion. First, there was the change of focus, moving to a focus on &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; and related technologies. Then there was the acquisition of Heptio by VMware, and all the change that comes with an acquisition. Just when things were starting to settle down, along came the acquisition of Pivotal by VMware and several more rounds of changes as a result. Today, I mark the start of another change, as I begin a new role and take the next step in my career journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Closing out the Tokyo Assignment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In late 2019, I announced that I would be &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2019/12/30/new-year-new-adventure/&#34;&gt;temporarily relocating to Tokyo for a six-month assignment&lt;/a&gt; to build out a team focused on cloud-native services and offerings. A few months later, I was still in Colorado, and I explained what was happening in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2020/03/09/an-update-on-the-tokyo-assignment/&#34;&gt;a status update on the Tokyo assignment&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few folks ask me about it, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d go ahead and share that the Tokyo assignment did not happen and will not happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Details on the New Desk Layout</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2021/01/04/details-on-new-desk-layout/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2021/01/04/details-on-new-desk-layout/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the holiday break I made some time to work on my desk layout, something I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to do for quite a while. I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to &amp;ldquo;up my game,&amp;rdquo; so to speak, with regard to producing more content, including some video content. Inspired by&amp;mdash;and heavily borrowing from&amp;mdash;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WedG8LKO6ks&#34;&gt;this YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;, I decided I wanted to create a similar arrangement for my desk. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share more details on my setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Update on the Tokyo Assignment</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/03/09/an-update-on-the-tokyo-assignment/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/03/09/an-update-on-the-tokyo-assignment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Right at the end of 2019 I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2019/12/30/new-year-new-adventure/&#34;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that in early 2020 I was temporarily relocating to Tokyo, Japan, for a six month work assignment. It&amp;rsquo;s now March, and I&amp;rsquo;m still in Colorado. So what&amp;rsquo;s up with that Tokyo assignment, anyway? Since I&amp;rsquo;ve had several folks ask, I figured it&amp;rsquo;s probably best to post something here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Removing Unnecessary Complexity</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2020/01/16/removing-unnecessary-complexity/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working to remove unnecessary complexity from my work environment. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say that I&amp;rsquo;m going full-on minimalist (not that there&amp;rsquo;s anything wrong with that), but I was beginning to feel like maintaining this complexity was taking focus, willpower, and mental capacity away from other, more valuable, efforts. Additionally, given the challenges I know lie ahead of me this year (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2019/12/30/new-year-new-adventure/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information), I suspect I&amp;rsquo;ll need all the focus, willpower, and mental capacity I can get!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As has been my custom over the last five years or so, in the early part of the year I like to share with my readers a list of personal projects for the upcoming year (here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2019/03/15/looking-ahead-2019-projects/&#34;&gt;the 2019 list&lt;/a&gt;). Then, near the end of that same year or very early in the following year, I evaluate how I performed against that list of personal projects (for example, here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2018/12/28/looking-back-2018-project-report-card/&#34;&gt;my project report card for 2018&lt;/a&gt;). In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll continue that pattern with an evaluation of my progress against my 2019 project list.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll skip the build-up and jump straight to the whole point of this post: a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity has come up and I&amp;rsquo;m embarking on a new adventure starting in early 2020. No, I&amp;rsquo;m not changing jobs&amp;hellip;but I am changing time zones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VMworld 2019 Prayer Time</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2019/07/23/vmworld-2019-prayer-time/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2019/07/23/vmworld-2019-prayer-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last several years, I&amp;rsquo;ve organized a brief morning prayer time at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vmworld.com/&#34;&gt;VMworld&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t attend the conference last year, but organized a prayer time nevertheless (and was able to join one morning for prayer). This year, now that I&amp;rsquo;m back at VMware (via the Heptio acquisition) and speaking at the conference, I&amp;rsquo;d once again like to coordinate a time for believers to meet. So, if you&amp;rsquo;re a Christian interested in gathering together with other Christians for a brief time of prayer, here are the details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Blogging Break</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to let readers know that there will be a break in my blogging over the next few weeks. Crystal and I are celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary and have decided to take a very long trip to someplace very far away from civilization so that we can relax, unplug, and simply enjoy each other&amp;rsquo;s company.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a little while now since I published &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2018/12/28/looking-back-2018-project-report-card/&#34;&gt;my 2018 project report card&lt;/a&gt;, which assessed my progress against &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2018/03/05/looking-ahead-2018-projects/&#34;&gt;my 2018 project goals&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving a fair amount of thought to the areas where I&amp;rsquo;d like to focus my professional (technical) development this coming year, and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with some project goals that align both with where I am professionally right now and where I want to be technically as I grow and evolve. This is a really difficult balance to strike, and we&amp;rsquo;ll see at the end of the year how well I did.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last five years or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve shared with my readers an annual list of projects along with&amp;mdash;at the year&amp;rsquo;s end&amp;mdash;a &amp;ldquo;project report card&amp;rdquo; on how I fared against the projects I&amp;rsquo;d set for myself. (For example, here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2018/01/03/looking-back-2017-project-report-card/&#34;&gt;my project report card for 2017&lt;/a&gt;.) Following that same pattern, then, here is my project report card for 2018.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2018/03/26/time-to-evolve/&#34;&gt;announced my departure from VMware&lt;/a&gt;, and my intention to step away from VMware&amp;rsquo;s products and platforms to focus on a new technology area moving forward. Today marks the &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; start of a journey that&amp;rsquo;s been building for a couple years, a journey that will take me into a future that&amp;rsquo;s containerized. That journey starts in Seattle, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Time to Evolve</title>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2018/03/26/time-to-evolve/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first started getting into &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vmware.com/&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt; around 2003, possibly earlier (I can&amp;rsquo;t recall exactly when it was). I remember thinking that VMware&amp;rsquo;s impact on the industry was going to be significant, and I wanted to be part of this industry change. I was right&amp;mdash;virtualization like what VMware offers has fundamentally changed the industry. However, just as technology evolves, technology careers must evolve as well. Specifically, my technology career must change and grow. It&amp;rsquo;s time to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last six years or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been publishing a list of projects/goals for the upcoming year (followed by a year-end review of how I did with those projects/goals). For example, here are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2017/01/31/looking-ahead-2017-projects/&#34;&gt;my goals for 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2018/01/03/looking-back-2017-project-report-card/&#34;&gt;my year-end review&lt;/a&gt; of my progress in 2017.
