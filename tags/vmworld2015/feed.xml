      <description>The day 2 keynote kicks off with another Cloud Academy presentation&amp;hellip; After the video wraps up, Sanjay Poonen takes the stage. Poonen briefly recaps yesterday&amp;rsquo;s messaging, and then moves into the focus of today&amp;rsquo;s keynote&amp;mdash;focusing on the &amp;ldquo;any application and any device&amp;rdquo; part of the &amp;ldquo;Ready for Any&amp;rdquo; messaging.
According to Poonen, the core of the solution for &amp;ldquo;any application on any device&amp;rdquo; is VMware&amp;rsquo;s Workspace Suite. Workspace Suite creates the magic of &amp;ldquo;enterprise computing with consumer simplicity.</description>

      <description>This is a liveblog for the Day 1 general session at VMworld 2015 in San Francisco. For many people, VMworld started yesterday with the Welcome Reception in the Solutions Exchange, but today marks the official kick-off to the event. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to end this liveblog shortly before the general session ends in order to make it to some customer meetings.
The keynote kicks off with a short video about the VMware Cloud Academy, where both &amp;ldquo;legacy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cloud-native&amp;rdquo; apps can enjoy the Unified Hybrid Cloud.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year again&amp;mdash;time for VMworld! And along with VMworld comes another highly-anticipated event: Spousetivities! That&amp;rsquo;s right, Spousetivities is back again this year for another set of outstanding activities organized for spouses traveling with conference attendees. If your spouse is traveling with you to San Francisco for VMworld, this is a great opportunity for him (or her) to meet up with other spouses and attend some exclusive activities.</description>

      <description>Last year, a group of believers gathered for a brief time of prayer while at VMworld 2014. This year, I&amp;rsquo;d like to again offer believers attending VMworld 2015 the same opportunity to gather together for a time of prayer before starting the day. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in attending, here are the details.
What: A brief time of prayer
Where: Yerba Buena Gardens, behind Moscone North (by the waterfall)
When: Monday 8/31 through Wednesday 9/2 at 7:45am (this should give everyone enough time to grab breakfast before the keynotes start at 9am)</description>
