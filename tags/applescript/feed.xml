      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had a need (OK, maybe more a desire than a need) to set my browser window(s) on macOS to a specific size, like 1920x1080. I initially started looking at one of the many macOS window managers, but after reading lots of reviews and descriptions and still being unclear if any of these products did what I wanted, I decided to step back to using AppleScript to accomplish what I was seeking. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share the solution (and the articles that helped me arrive at the solution).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
