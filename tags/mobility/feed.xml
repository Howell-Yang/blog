      <description>The fine folks over at Hyper9 recently offered me a very limited number of special beta invitations for Hyper9&amp;rsquo;s new Virtualization Mobile Manager (VMM) product. As you may already know, VMM is the brainchild of Andrew Kutz, who recently joined Hyper9 and has already released a few snippets of code via H9Labs.
Here are some highlights of VMM:
  Supports all major hypervisors: VMware Server 2, VMware Infrastructure 3 (VMware ESX and VMware ESXi 3.</description>

      <description>In case you&amp;rsquo;ve been hiding under a rock and haven&amp;rsquo;t yet heard (is that possible?), Apple today announced the iPhone:
http://www.apple.com/iphone
GSM/EDGE, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth&amp;hellip;runs an embedded form of OS X&amp;hellip;super-slick user interface&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s enough to make a gadget geek like me salivate.
If the iPhone works half as well as claimed, it will be a tremendous device. If it works as well as claimed, it will be a revolutionary device.</description>

      <description>Funambol, formerly Sync4j, is claiming that its latest product, Funambol 3, could function as an open-source Blackberry workaround, allowing push e-mail to be delivered to a variety of mobile devices, including Blackberries. This is particularly important in light of the threat of a Blackberry shutdown due to the RIM-NTP patent dispute.
Currently in beta, the v3 server software runs on Linux or Windows, and clients are available for Outlook, Windows Mobile, Blackberry, Palm, and (believe it or not) iPod.</description>
