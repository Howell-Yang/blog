I wanted to relay some information regarding choosing memory speeds and types for the new Intel Xeon 5500 (Nehalem family) processors. As stated in my previous article on the Nehalem CPUs, there are some decisions that need to be made when choosing the memory and processor combinations. Lets start off with what the memory architecture looks like.
  The current Xeon 5500 family is a two-socket configuration.</description>

Hello everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s Aaron again. Im sorry for falling off the radar for a bit. A new generation of Intel processors is upon us and I felt the need to come out of seclusion to share some recent findings regarding the new architecture. Todays article will explore the new processor offerings. I will be following this up with one (or more depending on the length) about the memory architecture and interconnects.</description>
