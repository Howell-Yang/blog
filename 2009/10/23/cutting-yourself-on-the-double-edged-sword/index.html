  <p>Yesterday I published a short post titled <a href="/2009/10/22/io-virtualization-and-the-double-edged-sword/">&ldquo;I/O Virtualization and the Double-Edged Sword&rdquo;</a>. In that post, I discussed how Xsigo was criticizing FCoE for &ldquo;not going far enough&rdquo; in the realm of I/O virtualization. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t do a very good job of really getting my point across, because the discussion rapidly turned into a discussion of the merits of various interconnect technologies and why one might win over the other. While that is a great discussion to have&mdash;and I&rsquo;m thrilled my site can help further that discussion&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t really the key point behind my article. I/O virtualization was only the catalyst to prompt the original post.</p>
<p>Let me see if I can more clearly articulate what I&rsquo;m trying to say here. If you are a <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> user and into virtualization or storage, then you probably are following either Chad Sakac of EMC (<a href="http://twitter.com/sakacc">@sakacc</a> on Twitter), Vaughn Stewart of NetApp (<a href="http://twitter.com/vaughn_stewart">@vaughn_stewart</a> on Twitter), or both. That being the case, you are probably very familiar with the extensive &ldquo;discussions&rdquo; that take place between the two of them. Both of them are very passionate about storage and virtualization, but they have differing viewpoints. Now, before I&rsquo;m accused by NetApp of being an EMC bigot (which would be ridiculous given the coverage I&rsquo;ve given NetApp) or accused by EMC of being a NetApp bigot (that, at least, might be understandable as I&rsquo;m just now starting to learn EMC storage), let me say that I&rsquo;m not endorsing either product. NetApp&rsquo;s products and EMC&rsquo;s products are different; each of them has strengths and weaknesses in different areas.</p>
<p>Now, ask yourself, &ldquo;Why do these products have different strengths and weaknesses?&rdquo; Do you know the answer? <strong>These products have different strengths and weaknesses because of the technology decisions each company chose to make in the products&rsquo; development.</strong> NetApp chose one path, EMC chose another. For NetApp, that has created certain efficiences, certain strengths&mdash;and corresponding weaknesses. Likewise, EMC&rsquo;s technology decisions have resulted in their products having certain strengths and weaknesses. Neither of these products is perfect. For NetApp to claim that &ldquo;their way is the right way&rdquo; is ridiculous; their way is only one of many different ways to accomplish something. The same is true for EMC. And, by extension, the same is true for <em>every other technology vendor on the planet.</em></p>
<p>You want more examples? Consider the architectural differences between VMware ESX/ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V. The technology choices made by each company created inherent strengths and weaknesses in each product. VMware claims their choices are the best choices; Microsoft believes their architecture is the best. Clearly, neither product is perfect. Both products have their flaws.</p>
<p>The real key takeaway here is that <em>no technology vendor has the right to throw rocks at another technology vendor.</em> All technology vendors live in glass houses. For VMware to claim that Microsoft&rsquo;s architecture is all wrong is, well, wrong. For EMC to say that NetApp&rsquo;s technology choices are stupid would be wrong. For Xsigo to claim that FCoE is the wrong path for I/O virtualization is wrong (although, personally, I don&rsquo;t consider FCoE an I/O virtualization technology, but that&rsquo;s a different discussion for a different day). Why? Because every company has to make technology choices, and those technology choices will&mdash;by the very nature of technology&mdash;automatically create inherent differences, strengths, and weaknesses in the resulting product. And when you accept that truth (and it <strong>is</strong> a truth, I promise you), then you see why vendors should not engage in negative marketing. When a vendor engages in negative marketing about the competition, that vendor is simply inviting others to pick apart the flaws in their own products.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m not naive enough to believe that vendors will stop negative competitive marketing overnight. Still, I stand firm in the belief that those vendors that focus on the strengths of their products instead of the flaws of others&rsquo; products will move ahead. I&rsquo;m certainly more likely to do business with them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be interested to hear what others have to say. Voice your position in the comments.</p>
