      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started migrating many of the applications on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://getfedora.org/&#34;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; 36 laptop to their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flatpak.org/&#34;&gt;Flatpak&lt;/a&gt; versions. For the most part, this has been pretty straightforward, although there isn&amp;rsquo;t really any method for migrating configuration and data. Today I ran into a problem with &lt;a href=&#34;https://meldmerge.org/&#34;&gt;Meld&lt;/a&gt;, a graphical diff utility, and using it with the &lt;code&gt;git difftool&lt;/code&gt; command. Below I&amp;rsquo;ll share how I worked around this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #155, just in time for the 2022 Memorial Day holiday weekend! (Here in the US, at least.) I mean, don&amp;rsquo;t you want to spend this weekend catching up on some technology-related articles instead of cooking on the grill and gathering with friends and family? I certainly hope not! Still, for those who need a little technology fix over the weekend, hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ve included something useful in the list of articles below. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Control Plane Access with Cluster API</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2022/05/12/fine-tuning-control-plane-access-with-cluster-api/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2022/05/12/fine-tuning-control-plane-access-with-cluster-api/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&#34;https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io&#34;&gt;Cluster API&lt;/a&gt; creates a workload cluster, it also creates a load balancing solution to handle traffic to the workload cluster&amp;rsquo;s control plane. This is necessary so that the control plane endpoint is decoupled from the underlying control plane nodes (which facilitates scaling the control plane, among other things). On AWS, this mean creating an ELB and a set of security groups. For flexibility, Cluster API provides a limited ability to customize this control plane load balancer. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to use this functionality to fine-tune access to a workload cluster&amp;rsquo;s control plane when using Cluster API with AWS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #154! My link of links and articles from around the Internet is a bit light on networking and virtualization this time around, but heftier in the security, cloud, and OS/application sections. I hope that I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to include something that you&amp;rsquo;ll find useful. Enjoy the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #153! My personal and professional life has kept me busy over the last couple of months, so things have been quiet here on the blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve still been collecting links to share with you, though, and here&amp;rsquo;s the latest collection. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re able to find something useful here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #152! Normally I&amp;rsquo;d publish a Technology Short Take in the morning on a Friday, but I really wanted to get this one out so I&amp;rsquo;m making it live late in the day on a Monday. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping I&amp;rsquo;ve included some content below that you find useful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using cert-manager with Kuma for mTLS</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2022/02/17/using-cert-manager-with-kuma-mtls/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2022/02/17/using-cert-manager-with-kuma-mtls/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When configuring mutual TLS (mTLS) on &lt;a href=&#34;https://kuma.io/&#34;&gt;the open source Kuma service mesh&lt;/a&gt;, users have a couple of different options. They can use a &amp;ldquo;builtin&amp;rdquo; certificate authority (CA), in which Kuma itself will generate a CA certificate and key for use in creating service-specific mTLS certificates. Users also have the option of using a &amp;ldquo;provided&amp;rdquo; CA, in which they must supply a CA certificate and key for Kuma to use when creating service-specific mTLS certificates. Both of these options are described &lt;a href=&#34;https://kuma.io/docs/1.4.x/policies/mutual-tls/&#34;&gt;on this page in the Kuma documentation&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore the use of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cert-manager.io/&#34;&gt;cert-manager&lt;/a&gt; as a &amp;ldquo;provided&amp;rdquo; CA for mTLS on Kuma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Follow Up: Bootstrapping Servers into Ansible</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2022/01/21/follow-up-bootstrapping-servers-ansible/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2022/01/21/follow-up-bootstrapping-servers-ansible/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, I wrote a quick post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2015/05/26/bootstrap-servers-ansible/&#34;&gt;bootstrapping servers into Ansible&lt;/a&gt;. The basic gist of the post was that you can use variables on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; command-line to specify hosts that aren&amp;rsquo;t part of your inventory or log in via a different user (useful if the host doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet have a dedicated Ansible user account because you want to use Ansible to create that account). Recently, though, I encountered a situation where this approach doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, and in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe the workaround.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #151, the first Technology Short Take of 2022. I hope everyone had a great holiday season and that 2022 is off to a wonderful start! I have a few more links than normal this time around, although I didn&amp;rsquo;t find articles in a couple categories. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;ll keep my eyes peeled and my RSS reader ready to pull in new articles in those categories for next time. And now for the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting Certificate Details from HashiCorp Vault</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2022/01/12/getting-certificate-details-from-hashicorp-vault/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2022/01/12/getting-certificate-details-from-hashicorp-vault/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems there are lots of tutorials on setting up a PKI (public key infrastructure) using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vaultproject.io/&#34;&gt;HashiCorp Vault&lt;/a&gt;. What I&amp;rsquo;ve found missing from most of these tutorials, however, is how to get details on certificates issued by a Vault-driven PKI &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the initial creation. For example, someone other than you issued a certificate, but now you need to get the details for said certificate. How is that done? In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you a couple ways to get details on certificates issued and stored in HashiCorp Vault.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Test-Driven Development for Kustomize Overlays</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2022/01/10/using-test-driven-development-for-kustomize-overlays/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am by no means a developer (not by a long shot!), but I have been learning lots of development-related things over the last several years and trying to incorporate those into my workflows. One of these is the idea of &lt;em&gt;test-driven development&lt;/em&gt; (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; for a definition and some additional information), in which one writes tests to validate functionality before writing the code to implement said functionality (pardon the paraphrasing). In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.conftest.dev/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;conftest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to (loosely) implement test-driven development for &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/kustomize/&#34;&gt;Kustomize&lt;/a&gt; overlays.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #150! This is the last Technology Short Take of 2021, so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll close the year out &amp;ldquo;with a bang&amp;rdquo; with this collection of links and articles on various technology areas. Bring on the content!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review: OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock</title>
      <link>https://www.howellyang.com/2021/12/23/review-owc-thunderbolt-dock/</link>

      <guid>https://www.howellyang.com/2021/12/23/review-owc-thunderbolt-dock/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About six months ago I purchased an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbolt-3-dock-14-port&#34;&gt;OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock&lt;/a&gt; to replace my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anker.com/a8396launch&#34;&gt;Anker PowerElite Thunderbolt 3 Dock&lt;/a&gt; (see my review &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.howellyang.com/2020/07/24/review-anker-powerexpand-elite-thunderbolt-3-dock/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). While there was nothing necessarily wrong with the Anker PowerElite, it lacked a digital audio port that I could use to send audio to a soundbar positioned under my monitor. (I&amp;rsquo;d grown accustomed to using a soundbar when my 2012 Mac Pro was my primary workstation.) In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide a brief review of the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #149! I&amp;rsquo;ll have one more Technology Short Take in 2021, scheduled for three weeks from now (on the last day of the year!). For now, though, I have a small collection of articles and links for your reading pleasure&amp;mdash;not as many as I usually include in a Technology Short Take, but better than nothing at all (I hope!). Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Technology Short Take #148, aka the Thanksgiving Edition (at least, for US readers). I&amp;rsquo;ve been scouring RSS feeds and various social media sites, collecting as many useful links and articles as I can find: from networking hardware and networking CI/CD pipelines to Kernel TLS and tricks for improving your working memory. That&amp;rsquo;s quite the range! I hope that you find something useful here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
