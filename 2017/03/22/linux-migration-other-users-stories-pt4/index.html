  <p>This post is part of a series of posts sharing other users&rsquo; stories about their migration to Linux as their primary desktop OS. As I mentioned in <a href="/2017/03/01/linux-migration-other-users-stories-pt1/">part 1 of the series</a>, there seemed to be quite a bit of pent-up interest in using Linux as your primary desktop OS. I thought it might be helpful to readers to hear not just about my migration, but also about others&rsquo; migrations. You may also find it interesting/helpful to read <a href="/2017/03/06/linux-migration-other-users-stories-pt2/">part 2</a> and <a href="/2017/03/10/linux-migration-other-users-stories-pt3/">part 3</a> of this series for more migration stories.</p>
<p>This time around I&rsquo;ll share with you some information from Ajay Chenampara about his Linux migration. Note that although these stories are all structured in a &ldquo;question-and-answer&rdquo; format, the information is unique&mdash;just as each person&rsquo;s migration and the reasons for the migration are unique.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why did you switch to Linux?</strong></p>
<p>I have been a long-time Linux user, but I have only really used it as a media server or for casual browsing. Recently, I inherited a 7 year old laptop from my wife, and decided to focus on making it my primary system for writing my blog and for OSS efforts. Plus, I kept hearing about <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/">Debian &ldquo;Jessie&rdquo;</a> from the blogosphere, so I wanted to give that distribution a shot as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, I recently changed jobs. At my new job, I have the option to use any operating system (OS), and I naturally gravitated toward Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What hardware are you using with Linux?</strong></p>
<p>At first, I was using an older laptop that I inherited from my wife. I used this to get started on my Linux migration journey, focusing on writing my blog and other open source efforts. After changing jobs, though, I did some in-depth research and ended up a Lenovo P50 with a 6820HQ processor and 40GB of RAM (<a href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/P50-P70-linux-experiences/td-p/2251327">here&rsquo;s a thread</a> of other people&rsquo;s experience with Linux on the P50). I tend to run lots of VMs, so the extra RAM is really helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What were you using before switching to Linux?</strong></p>
<p>At my previous job, I had been using an Apple MacBook Pro. I realized that 80-90% the applications I used on the MacBook Pro were pretty much identical to what I&rsquo;d use on Linux. This made the switch a no-brainer, especially given the additional control I get on the system.</p>
<p>The applications I use mostly are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/index.html">Emacs</a>
<ul>
<li>It serves as my primary text editor</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also my organizer (org-mode for the win!)</li>
<li>My primary integrated development environment (IDE) (projectile + python + magit is pretty much what I use)</li>
<li>My primary slide/presentation editor (org-reveal + reveal.js is awesome)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vim (I am a long time vim user and sometimes just revert to vim)</li>
<li>O365 + OmniGraffle (note: I haven&rsquo;t really tested out the O365 equivalent on the Linux laptop, given that it is not my work. For drawings, I think LibreOffice is satisfactory, at least for now)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q: What sort of challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?</strong></p>
<p>Wi-Fi and WebEx were the worst. On the older laptop, I had a Broadcom wireless chip and used the b43 kernel module. However, in spite of having the firmware, I kept running into random Wi-Fi drops. At this point, I have tried so many things that I no longer know which step actually fixed it, but for now, I have reliable connectivity.</p>
<p>Getting WebEx to work was the other big-time killer. I first went with Chromium (open source version of Chrome), and then realized that the 32-bit <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Iceweasel">Iceweasel</a> plugin was the way to go. (For those who don&rsquo;t know, Iceweaseal is the Debian-branded version of Firefox.) However, if you are going down this path, please remember to uninstall the old plugin. Without that step, the new plugin is of no help.</p>
<p>Going with a basic distro, however, I had to install a bunch of software to get my environment the way I liked it (Docky, scudcloud, terminator, tmux, synapse, etc.). None of this was too complex. I do love the Greybeard theme on XFCE. Given that I was using a 7-year-old laptop at the time, it really flew!</p>
<p>On my new Lenovo, I installed a pre-release testing version of <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/">Debian &ldquo;Stretch&rdquo;</a> (the next major version of Debian) after creating a recovery disk for the installation of Windows 10 Pro that came on the laptop. Unfortunately, the HDMI port wouldn&rsquo;t work. I tried all the various suggestions I found online (such as <a href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-P-and-W-Series-Mobile/Lenovo-P50-HDMI-not-working/td-p/2264525">this thread</a>), but realized I would need to pivot. I installed <a href="https://help.webex.com/docs/DOC-3921">Xubuntu</a>&mdash;I wanted to preserve my XFCE experience&mdash;and found that the external display now worked. After spending a fair amount of time customizing my environment, installing applications, setting up my &ldquo;dot-files&rdquo; (configuration files), and even getting WebEx Meeting Center working, I then realized that there was no support for WebEx personal meeting rooms on Linux.</p>
<p>This was a problem for me. I spent another afternoon and evening restoring Windows 10 Pro&mdash;but only long enough to perform a physical-to-virtual (P2V) conversion into a disk image. I then re-loaded Xubuntu and spun up my Windows 10 Pro instance using VMware Player.</p>
<p>To this moment, WebEx has been the biggest thorn in my Linux migration. Even with Meeting Center, which works natively, I cannot use the computer audio. <a href="https://help.webex.com/docs/DOC-3921">This document</a>, originally written in 2015 and updated in 2017, still proclaims no support for Linux. I&rsquo;m baffled why that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>This forces me into a bit of an ugly hack when I need to share my Linux desktop. I have to start the x11vnc server (so that I can console into the Linux instance via RDP from Windows), spin up the Windows VM, and RDP back to the host. It works, but it&rsquo;s definitely a hack.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What benefits have you seen after the switch?</strong></p>
<p>Well, for one I have a beautiful work environment that requires minimal mouse movement and is really fast! I have a great deal of power and control over the environment, and I have an environment that makes it easier to contribute back to the community and learn more about how computers and operating systems work.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Anything else you&rsquo;d like others to know?</strong></p>
<p>You should really try out emacs org-mode! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4">Here&rsquo;s a video</a> that will help you get started.</p>
