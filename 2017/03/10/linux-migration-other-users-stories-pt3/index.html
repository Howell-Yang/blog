  <p>Over the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been sharing various users&rsquo; stories about their own personal migration to Linux. If you&rsquo;ve not read them already, I encourage you to check out <a href="/2017/03/01/linux-migration-other-users-stories-pt1/">part 1</a> and <a href="/2017/03/06/linux-migration-other-users-stories-pt2/">part 2</a> of this multi-part series to get a feel for why folks are deciding to switch to Linux, the challenges they faced, and the benefits they&rsquo;ve seen (so far). Obviously, Linux isn&rsquo;t the right fit for everyone, but at least by sharing these stories you&rsquo;ll get a better feel whether it&rsquo;s a right fit for you.</p>
<p>This is Brian Hall&rsquo;s story of switching to Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why did you switch to Linux?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been an OS X user since 2010. It was a huge change coming from Windows, especially since the laptop I bought had the first SSD that I&rsquo;ve had in my primary machine. I didn&rsquo;t think it could get any better. Over the years that feeling started to wear off.</p>
<p>OS X started to feel bloated. It seemed like OS X started to get in my way more and more often. I ended up formatting and reinstalling OSX like I used to do with Windows (maybe not quite as often). Setting up Mail to work the way I wanted it to was a pain. I had apps for everything. That started out fun, but when it came to getting my data out of each of them it was a tough job.</p>
<p>I wanted this to change. It seemed like getting my personal machine set up the way I was using it was entirely too complex. If my machine were to die, it would take me weeks to get it back to the way it was. I wanted to simplify as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Which Linux distribution are you using?</strong></p>
<p>I switched from OS X to Ubuntu GNOME.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What sort of challenges did you face, and how did you work around these challenges?</strong></p>
<p>For me, there was one challenge. When I first started &ldquo;evaluating&rdquo; (evaluating is probably too formal a word) different distributions I was trying to make them work exactly like my Mac, which always failed. I realized that I changed just about everything about the way I was working when I switched from Windows to OS X. I had to be willing to change the way I was doing some things for me to complete the move. I don&rsquo;t think this is a requirement for everyone who wants to switch to Linux. The point is this: you will likely need to be willing to change a few things.</p>
<p>My first step in my migration was to simplify the way I was working on my Mac first, then try to move again. This made everything a lot easier. I did away with a lot of the dedicated apps I was using (writing apps, GTD apps, note taking, etc). I started using open data formats for everything I was doing (basically, plain text for everything). I started using web-based email and the web interfaces for Twitter, cross-platform apps, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What benefits have you seen after the switch?</strong></p>
<p>Since I made the switch I can say for certain that my setup has gotten a lot simpler. It would take me less than a day to rebuild my machine to the point where it is now. Another benefit has been performance (I reduced how much my machine swaps by reducing the &ldquo;vm.swappiness&rdquo; value to 10 in <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code>). I still own a MacBook, which is the only laptop I have, and I never thought I would say that it felt slow. I spend a <strong>lot</strong> less time tweaking my machine to behave the way I want.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there anything else you&rsquo;d like readers to know?</strong></p>
<p>I still own and use an iPhone and an Apple TV, so I haven&rsquo;t completely removed Apple from my computing landscape. I mention this because a lot of people think that it has to be &ldquo;all or none,&rdquo; and I haven&rsquo;t found that to be the case.</p>
<p>I also wanted to mention a couple of very useful applications I&rsquo;ve found along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://enpass.io">Enpass</a> is a great password manager (a reasonable replacement for 1Password on OS X, if you use that)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.odrive.com">odrive</a> is a good cloud storage client that supports Linux</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/firehol/netdata">Netdata</a> is awesome for local performance monitoring</li>
</ul>
