  <p>Last week while attending the CloudStack Collaboration Conference in my home city of Denver, I had a bit of a realization. I wanted to share it here in the hopes that it might serve as an encouragement for others out there.</p>
<p>Long-time readers know that one of my projects over the last couple of years has been to become more fluent in Linux (refer back to <a href="/2012/01/02/some-projects-for-2012/">my 2012 project list</a> and <a href="/2013/02/07/looking-ahead-my-2013-projects/">my 2013 project list</a>). I gave myself a B+ for my efforts last year, feeling that I had made good progress over the course of the year. Even so, I still felt like there was still so much that I needed to learn. As so many of us are inclined to do, I was more focused on what I still hadn&rsquo;t learned instead of taking a look at what I had learned.</p>
<p>This is where last week comes in. Before the conference started, I participated in a couple of &ldquo;mini boot camps&rdquo; focused on CloudStack and related tools/clients/libraries. (You may have seen some of my tweets about tools like cloudmonkey, Apache libcloud, and awscli/ec2stack.) As I worked through the boot camps, I could hear the questions that other attendees were asking as well as the tasks with which others were struggling. Folks were wrestling with what I thought were pretty simple tasks; these were not, after all, very complex exercises. So the lab guide wasn&rsquo;t complete or correct; you should be able to figure it out, right?</p>
<p>Then it hit me. <em>I&rsquo;m a Linux guy now.</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right&mdash;I had crossed the threshold between &ldquo;working on being a Linux guy&rdquo; and &ldquo;being a Linux guy.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not that I know everything there is to know (far from it!), but that the base level of knowledge had finally accrued to a level where&mdash;upon closer inspection&mdash;I realized that I was fluent enough that I could perform most common tasks without a great deal of effort. I knew enough to know what to do when something didn&rsquo;t work, or wasn&rsquo;t configured properly, and the general direction in which to look when trying to determine exactly what was going on.</p>
<p>At this point you might be wondering, &ldquo;What does that have to do with encouraging me?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a fair question.</p>
<p>As IT professionals&mdash;especially those on the individual contributor (IC) track instead of the management track&mdash;we are tasked with having to constantly learn new products, new technologies, and new methodologies. Because the learning never stops (and that isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, in my humble opinion), we tend to focus on what we <em>haven&rsquo;t</em> mastered. We forget to look at what we <em>have</em> learned, at the progress that we <em>have</em> made. Maybe, like me, you&rsquo;re on a journey of learning and education to move from being a specialist in one type of technology to a practitioner of another type. If that&rsquo;s the case, perhaps it&rsquo;s time you stop saying &ldquo;I <em>will be</em> a &lt;new technology&gt; person&rdquo; and say &ldquo;I <em>am</em> a &lt;new technology&gt; person.&rdquo; Perhaps it&rsquo;s time for you to cross the threshold.</p>
