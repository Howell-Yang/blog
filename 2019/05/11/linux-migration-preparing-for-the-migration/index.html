  <p>As far back as 2012, I was <a href="/2012/11/30/why-i-might-leave-os-x/">already thinking</a> about migrating away from Mac OS X (now known as macOS). While the migration didn&rsquo;t <a href="/2016/12/16/linux-migration-initial-progress-report/">start in earnest until late 2016</a>, a fair amount of work happened in advance of the migration. Since I&rsquo;ve had a number of folks ask me about migrating to Linux, I thought I&rsquo;d supplement <a href="/2018/12/23/the-linux-migration-series/">my Linux migration series</a> with a &ldquo;prequel&rdquo; about some of the work that happened to prepare for the migration.</p>
<p>In the end&mdash;and I imagine some folks may get upset or offended at this&mdash;an operating system (OS) is really just a vehicle to deliver applications to the user. While users like myself have strong preferences about their OS and how their OS works, ultimately it is the ability to &ldquo;get things done&rdquo; that really matters. This is why I ended up suspending my Linux migration in August 2017; I didn&rsquo;t have access to the applications I needed in order to do what I needed to do. (Though, to be fair, part of that was a lack of growth on my part, though that&rsquo;s a different blog post for a different day.)</p>
<p>To that end, most of the work I did in advance of the migration involved three key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the tasks I needed to do and the workflows used to do them</li>
<li>Mapping my tasks to applications</li>
<li>Freeing data from proprietary formats</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at each of these individually. Keep in mind there&rsquo;s a pretty fair amount of &ldquo;fluidity&rdquo; among these three areas; each area is both informed by and informs the other areas.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-my-tasks-and-workflows">Understanding my Tasks and Workflows</h2>
<p>In order to know if you&rsquo;ll be able to do what you need to do using Linux (or Windows, or macOS; it applies equally regardless of your destination OS), you first need to fully understand what you need to do. I know this sounds simplistic&mdash;&ldquo;How could I <em>not</em> know what I need to do?&rdquo;&mdash;but it can be easy to overlook things when you&rsquo;ve gotten into a comfortable workflow. On three separate occasions between 2012 (when I first started considering migrating away from macOS) and 2016 (when I actually kicked off a migration), I thoroughly examined the &ldquo;things I do&rdquo; (my tasks) as well as how I did those things (my workflows). These examinations exposed potential areas of concern, such as the use of OS-specific scripting functionality (AppleScript) or areas where I had not yet identified a replacement application (see the next section).</p>
<p>I also took this time to identify &ldquo;critical&rdquo; tasks&mdash;what are the things that I <em>absolutely</em> needed to be able to do, and what are the things it would merely be nice to be able to do?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re considering a migration and haven&rsquo;t yet done something like this, I&rsquo;d <em>strongly</em> urge you to run through this exercise first. When you do, you&rsquo;ll also want to consider any tasks that are being done &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; for you. For example, when I was on macOS I used a tool called <a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com/">Hazel</a> to automatically organize files in specific folders. This was a task I needed to do, but which was being done automatically. By making sure to include such tasks, I was able to have a clearer view of what life would be like after the migration.</p>
<h2 id="mapping-tasks-to-applications">Mapping Tasks to Applications</h2>
<p>Once you have a good understanding of the things you need to do, then it&rsquo;s time to determine if that functionality exists on your target platform (Linux, in my case). So, in addition to examining my tasks and workflows on multiple occasions, I also went through <em>every single application</em> that was installed on my systems to determine if a Linux equivalent or replacement existed. Early in the timeline (in 2013), I hadn&rsquo;t yet identified replacement applications for many of my macOS applications. As time progressed and I spent more time researching, I identified more and more replacement applications (or I migrated away from such applications; see the next section). In some cases, I realized I didn&rsquo;t use that application very much, and so I stopped using it entirely because my task analysis (what I described in the previous section) indicated that it wasn&rsquo;t needed for any critical tasks. In other cases, I migrated to software-as-a-service (SaaS) alternatives when an equivalent Linux application wasn&rsquo;t available.</p>
<p>This step&mdash;and the next step regarding data formats&mdash;are likely going to be fairly time-consuming, and you&rsquo;ll very likely need to iterate a couple of times through the process. Of course, it&rsquo;s probable that a fair amount of this will be driven by your job and your employer, who will dictate certain requirements/standards. Be sure to keep that in mind.</p>
<h2 id="freeing-data-from-proprietary-formats">Freeing Data from Proprietary Formats</h2>
<p>Proprietary data formats were on my mind <a href="/2011/09/07/switching-to-eaglefiler/">as far back as 2011</a>, in advance of my first published mention of migrating away from macOS. It was around that time that I started strongly embracing <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and more platform-independent file formats. In looking back over it now, I realize that my embrace of Markdown led to other notable changes in my workflows and applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/2014/12/18/blog-migration-in-the-works/">blog migration from WordPress to Jekyll/GitHub Pages</a> was driven largely by my desire to use Markdown for blogging (as well as a desire to more fully include <code>git</code> in my regular workflows). It also had the nice effect of freeing me from a macOS-specific application I&rsquo;d been using to make blogging easier, and unlocking my blog content into a more portable format.</li>
<li>My use of Markdown for presentations (first via Deckset as described <a href="/2015/02/18/presentations-markdown-deckset/">here</a>, later via Remark.js as described <a href="/2017/03/07/linux-migration-creating-presentations/">here</a>) helped lessen my reliance on proprietary presentation applications. I moved <em>all</em> my personal presentations to Markdown (well, variants of Markdown).</li>
</ul>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just about Markdown, though Markdown was helpful and played a large role. I had to identify <em>every</em> instance where data was being stored in some proprietary, non-portable format and use that information hand-in-hand with the application research to determine the best course of action. In some cases, there was no migration path. In other cases, I could use an intermediate format that served as a &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; between the old application and the new application. In yet other cases, I could export proprietary data formats to a standard-based format (often text-based, like OPML or XML) that I could open and manipulate with a text editor (which had now become perhaps the most important application I used). The ideal scenario is when the new application supported importing the data formats of the old application (support in <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> for working with Microsoft Office documents is a great example).</p>
<p>Those of you considering a migration to a new OS will need to undergo a similar process. I hope that those of you thinking about migrating to Linux find the information I&rsquo;ve shared here and in the rest of <a href="/2018/12/23/the-linux-migration-series/">the Linux migration series</a> helpful and informative.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>The gap of four years between when I first mentioned switching away from macOS and when I actually started a migration in earnest is due partially to a lack of urgency on my part, but there <em>was</em> stuff happening in that time. As I&rsquo;ve described in the previous sections, I did spend quite a bit of time thoroughly exploring how I was spending my time, the workflows I was using, the applications I was running, and the data formats that were in use. Armed with that knowledge, I was then able to identify a path forward&mdash;either identifying a replacement application and/or replacement data format, migrating to a different application or different data format, or completely retiring applications and data formats that were no longer essential for me. Could I have done this in less time? Oh, most certainly! My point is, though, that anyone considering switching to Linux&mdash;or to any alternate OS&mdash;is going to need to go through a similar set of exercises in order for their migration to also be successful.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking of migrating to Linux, I&rsquo;d love to hear from you and possibly help answer any questions you may have. Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lowe">contact me on Twitter</a>!</p>
