  <p>As has been my custom over the last five years or so, in the early part of the year I like to share with my readers a list of personal projects for the upcoming year (here&rsquo;s <a href="/2019/03/15/looking-ahead-2019-projects/">the 2019 list</a>). Then, near the end of that same year or very early in the following year, I evaluate how I performed against that list of personal projects (for example, here&rsquo;s <a href="/2018/12/28/looking-back-2018-project-report-card/">my project report card for 2018</a>). In this post, I&rsquo;ll continue that pattern with an evaluation of my progress against my 2019 project list.</p>
<p>For reference, here&rsquo;s the list of projects I set out for myself for 2019 (you can read <a href="/2019/03/15/looking-ahead-2019-projects/">the associated blog post</a>, if you like, for additional context):</p>
<ol>
<li>Make at least one code contribution to an open source project. <em>(Stretch goal: Make three code contributions to open source projects.)</em></li>
<li>Add at least three new technology areas to my &ldquo;learning-tools&rdquo; repository. <em>(Stretch goal: Add five new technology areas to the &ldquo;learning-tools&rdquo; repository.)</em></li>
<li>Become more familiar with CI/CD solutions and patterns.</li>
<li>Create at least three non-written content pieces. <em>(Stretch goal: Create five pieces of non-written content.)</em></li>
<li>Complete a &ldquo;wildcard project&rdquo; (if applicable).</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how I would grade myself on my progress against this project list:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Make at least one code contribution to an open source project:</em> When I set out this goal for myself, I was thinking that I would contribute using Golang, and this would help &ldquo;force&rdquo; me to learn Golang in more depth. That, unfortunately, did not happen. If I were to grade myself only on that, I&rsquo;d have to give myself an F. However, I did make other contributions. I had five infrastructure-as-code contributions to one project and two contributions to another project in Bash. So, I did achieve the <em>letter</em> of this goal, but not the <em>spirit</em> of the goal. Grade: <strong>C</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Add at least three new technology areas to my &ldquo;learning-tools&rdquo; repository:</em> <a href="https://github.com/scottslowe/learning-tools">My GitHub &ldquo;learning-tools&rdquo; repository</a> is a collection of&hellip;well, tools to help folks learn new technologies. I did spend a fair amount of time this year paying down technical debt in the repository by updating documentation, adding missing documentation, fixing bugs, updating versions of software, etc. However, this wasn&rsquo;t the focus on the project; the focus of the project was on expanding the coverage found in the repository. In that regard, I did manage to add two new areas (one area covering the use of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api">Cluster API</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize"><code>kustomize</code></a>, and another area on <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a>). I suppose if you counted CAPI and <code>kustomize</code> as two different areas then I did make it to my stated target of three new technology areas, but that seems like padding the statistics. Grade: <strong>B</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Become more familiar with CI/CD solutions and patterns:</em> This was a really vague project, which I recognized when I published my list of 2019 projects. I <em>am</em> now more familiar with CI/CD terminology and with tools or projects commonly used in CI/CD solutions, but I don&rsquo;t have any concrete measurables by which to gauge my progress. If I had, for example, added a technology area to the &ldquo;learning-tools&rdquo; repository for a particular CI/CD tool, then I&rsquo;d have something concrete. Given the lack of concrete measurables, I&rsquo;d say I did not make the progress I really need(ed) to make. Grade: <strong>D</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Create at least three non-written content pieces:</em> This one is a bit tricky. On one hand, I did create several videos that have been published on <a href="https://kube.academy/">KubeAcademy</a>. However, should I count that? In my head, I was thinking of content I would create separate from work, like the content I create for this site, but I didn&rsquo;t specify that. I guess I&rsquo;ll split it halfway. Grade: <strong>C</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Complete a &ldquo;wildcard project&rdquo; (if applicable):</em> As with 2018, I don&rsquo;t think that I have anything that really qualifies as a &ldquo;wildcard project.&rdquo; I did say, though, that I wouldn&rsquo;t penalize myself if I didn&rsquo;t complete one. Grade: <strong>N/A</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, progress against my project list was fair&mdash;not great, but also not awful. Is there room to improve? Absolutely!</p>
<p>Even though I didn&rsquo;t do as well on my progress against this project list as I would&rsquo;ve liked, the pursuit of progress did yield some valuable benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>In working on video content, I learned of new tools (OBS Studio), learned new techniques for existing tools (like Camtasia), and gained experience in creating video content&mdash;all things which will be useful down the road.</li>
<li>In trying to bolster my Golang skills enough to make a code contribution, I learned that I need more resources&mdash;so I invested in some video training on Golang that I hope will help.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next week or two I&rsquo;ll be brainstorming and evaluating potential projects for 2020. This will be a challenge given <a href="/2019/12/30/new-year-new-adventure/">the upcoming adventure for the new year</a>, as I need to find projects that will align with&mdash;or at the very least not interfere with&mdash;efforts related to living in Tokyo, learning Japanese, and building out a team in Japan.</p>
<p>Additionally, the process of looking back on this list and evaluating my progress against the list was very useful in exposing &ldquo;unspoken&rdquo; assumptions about the items on the list. For the upcoming year, I not only need to provide specific, measurable goals, but I also need to be specific in spelling out these assumptions.</p>
<p>In the meantime, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lowe">contact me on Twitter</a> if you&rsquo;d like to provide any feedback, suggest projects or goals I should consider, or if you just want to say hi. Thanks for reading!</p>
