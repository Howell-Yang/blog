  <p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been working to remove unnecessary complexity from my work environment. I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m going full-on minimalist (not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that), but I was beginning to feel like maintaining this complexity was taking focus, willpower, and mental capacity away from other, more valuable, efforts. Additionally, given the challenges I know lie ahead of me this year (see <a href="/2019/12/30/new-year-new-adventure/">here</a> for more information), I suspect I&rsquo;ll need all the focus, willpower, and mental capacity I can get!</p>
<p>When I say &ldquo;unnecessary complexity,&rdquo; by the way, I&rsquo;m referring to added complexity that doesn&rsquo;t bring any real or significant benefit. Sometimes there&rsquo;s no getting around the complexity, but when that complexity doesn&rsquo;t create any value, it&rsquo;s unnecessary in my definition.</p>
<p>Primarily, this &ldquo;reduction in complexity&rdquo; shows up in three areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>My computing environment</li>
<li>My home office setup</li>
<li>My lab resources</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="my-computing-environment">My Computing Environment</h2>
<p>Readers who have followed me for more than a couple years know that I migrated away from macOS for about 9 months in 2017 (see <a href="/2017/10/25/linux-migration-wrap-up/">here</a> for a wrap-up of that effort), then again in 2018 when I joined Heptio (some details are available in <a href="/2018/12/31/linux-migration-december-2018-progress-report/">this update</a>). Since switching to <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a> on a Lenovo X1 Carbon when I joined Heptio, I was using Linux on the desktop full-time. (<a href="/2018/12/23/the-linux-migration-series/">This post</a> contains links to all the posts I wrote about my Linux migration.)</p>
<p>About a month ago, though, I switched back to macOS (macOS Mojave, specifically). Why? Although I was making Linux work for me, there was just enough &ldquo;extra friction&rdquo; in daily tasks to make it more of a chore than I felt it needed to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>E-mail connectivity to Office 365 was a challenge (my employer shut down IMAP/SMTP access to e-mail).</li>
<li>Calendaring was difficult, at best, and the shared calendar for my team totally confused most solutions I tried.</li>
<li>Interoperability between LibreOffice and Office 365 remained subpar (at best) for all but the most basic documents, unfortunately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrast that with macOS, where in a matter of minutes I had full connectivity to e-mail, full calendar access (including the shared team calendar), and a working version of Office 365. I also had multi-lingual support working with relative ease, something with which I suspect Linux desktop environments would&rsquo;ve struggled.</p>
<p>Although I had workable solutions (use a Windows 10 desktop on VMware View for some things, use the Office web applications for other aspects), these solutions still introduced what I felt was unnecessary complexity. So, to remove this unnecessary complexity, I switched back to macOS full-time.</p>
<p>I also switched back to iOS (I bought an iPhone 11 Pro) from Android (I&rsquo;d been using a Google Pixel). Given that I was moving back into the Apple ecosystem, and given that using an Android-powered phone had made it a bit more difficult to stay in touch with my wife when I was traveling, it didn&rsquo;t seem to make sense to continue down that path. There was no significant benefit in exchange for the added friction.</p>
<h2 id="my-home-office-setup">My Home Office Setup</h2>
<p>In addition to simplifying my computing environment, I also set out to simplify my home office setup. For years, I&rsquo;d used both a 2012-era Mac Pro (one of the classic aluminum tower systems, which I&rsquo;d purchased to help with video rendering) and a laptop, and used tools like <a href="https://symless.com/synergy">Synergy</a> (to have a single shared keyboard and mouse across both systems) and <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">Unison</a> (to keep files synchronized across both systems). In reality, though, I didn&rsquo;t <em>need</em> the Mac Pro as a desktop system; I really needed it more like a server system to which I could offload rendering tasks.</p>
<p>Around the same time I switched back to macOS, I also switched back to a single-computer setup. I no longer use Synergy to share a keyboard and mouse across multiple systems; instead, I have only my 2017 13&quot; MacBook Pro. It uses a USB-C port replicator to connect to an external monitor (the same 34&quot; 21:9 ultra-wide monitor I&rsquo;d been using previously), external keyboard, external microphone and webcam, and USB-based headset for Zoom meetings. I use a small application named <a href="https://www.controlplaneapp.com/">ControlPlane</a> to automatically adjust settings based on whether the laptop is &ldquo;docked&rdquo; or not. Plug the laptop in, and it reconfigures itself; unplug it, and it automatically adapts.</p>
<p>The Mac Pro sits off to the side; I&rsquo;m still working out details on exactly how I&rsquo;ll utilize it. It&rsquo;s still running Linux (Fedora, specifically), and will most likely continue to do so; since it isn&rsquo;t being used as a desktop system I see little value in moving back to macOS on that hardware. It&rsquo;ll probably take over tasks from an aging Mac mini as well as helping with video rendering tasks, once I figure out the specific details on the best way to make that work.</p>
<h2 id="my-lab-resources">My Lab Resources</h2>
<p>Making mention of the aging Mac mini naturally leads me into the last area, my lab resources. This effort actually started a few years ago when I moved into my current home. Prior to that, I ran a full-fledged home lab: eight dual-socket Dell servers as hypervisors (a mix of KVM and ESXi), 10Gb and 40Gb Ethernet with multiple VLANs, multiple VMs running for a variety of purposes. When I moved into the current house, though, I did away with <em>all</em> of it except the Mac mini and an Apple Time Capsule. Moving &ldquo;up the stack&rdquo; to focus on things like Linux containers and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> meant there wasn&rsquo;t as much value in running all this hardware, and why spend time managing all that complexity if I didn&rsquo;t really need to?</p>
<p>Instead, I started leveraging ephemeral instances in AWS for everything I needed when it came to &ldquo;lab resources.&rdquo; Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve used that approach to strengthen and expand my skills around infrastructure-as-code. My current approach leverages <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a> to manage a base set of AWS resources in multiple regions. Additional capacity is spun up on-demand, and shut down when it&rsquo;s no longer actively needed. Since it&rsquo;s almost exclusively Kubernetes I&rsquo;m using, I leverage <code>kubeadm</code> and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api">Cluster API</a> to create and destroy Kubernetes clusters as needed. Yes, there are some limitations, but for the most part this arrangement has worked reasonably well.</p>
<p>Anyone else undertaken a similar journey? I&rsquo;d be interested to hear from you, and perhaps learn of some additional ways I may be able to simplify and eliminate unnecessary complexity. Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lowe">reach out to me on Twitter</a>, or drop me an e-mail (my e-mail address isn&rsquo;t hard to find, to be honest). Thanks!</p>
