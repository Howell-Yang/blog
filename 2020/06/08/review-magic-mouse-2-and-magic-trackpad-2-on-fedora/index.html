  <p>I recently purchased a new Apple Magic Mouse 2 and an Apple Magic Trackpad 2&mdash;not to use with my MacBook Pro, but to use with my <a href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a>-powered laptop (a Lenovo 5th generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon; see <a href="/2018/04/13/review-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon/">my review</a>). I know it seems odd to buy Apple accessories for a non-Apple laptop, and in this post I&rsquo;d like to talk about why I bought these items as well as provide some (relatively early) feedback on how well they work with Fedora.</p>
<h2 id="the-justificationbackground">The Justification/Background</h2>
<p>First, let me talk about the <em>why</em> behind my purchase of these items. Several years ago, I started simultaneously using both an external trackpad/touchpad <em>and</em> an external mouse with my macOS-based home office setup. I realize this is probably odd, but I adopted the practice as a way of eliminating &ldquo;mouse finger&rdquo; on my right hand. With this arrangement, I stopped trying to scroll with my right-hand (either using a mouse wheel with older mice or using the scroll-enabled back of the Magic Mouse), and instead shifting scrolling to my left hand (using two-finger scrolling on the trackpad). This &ldquo;division of labor&rdquo; worked well. Because my existing Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad&mdash;both earlier generations&mdash;don&rsquo;t work with non-Apple laptops, I had to give up this arrangement when I switched to Linux. Sure enough, though, my index finger on my right hand started hurting again from the use of the scroll wheel. Switching fingers helped only temporarily. I needed to go back to a solution that allowed me to do two-finger scrolling.</p>
<p>After searching quite a bit for a Linux-compatible external trackpad, I <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lowe/status/1268606420540198913">put out a query on Twitter</a>. A couple folks responded with the Magic Trackpad 2, which I&rsquo;d seen referenced in other places as a potential candidate as well. I was skeptical (the original generation product hadn&rsquo;t worked <em>at all</em> with Linux), I went ahead and ordered both a Magic Trackpad 2 and a Magic Mouse 2 (both in &ldquo;Space Gray,&rdquo; so as to match my keyboard&mdash;no sense in giving up aesthetics!). In the next couple of sections, I&rsquo;ll provide my feedback after a few hours of using the devices with Fedora 31.</p>
<h2 id="pairing">Pairing</h2>
<p>My intent was to use both devices wirelessly, so as to preserve USB ports. I unboxed the Magic Trackpad 2 first. Upon powering up the device, it immediately appeared in the Bluetooth settings screen on my laptop, and with a single-click I paired it with Fedora. No muss, no fuss&mdash;it just worked. Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>I followed that up with the Magic Mouse 2, which I was using to replace a wired Microsoft Intellimouse Pro. Just like the Magic Trackpad 2, it immediately paired with the laptop with no issues whatsoever.</p>
<h2 id="functionality">Functionality</h2>
<p>Out of the box, all of the functionality of the Magic Trackpad 2 worked with no configuration needed. Mind you, I&rsquo;m using GNOME on X11 (not Wayland, because reasons), so &ldquo;all of the functionality&rdquo; is two-finger scrolling, clicking with one finger (primary button), and clicking with two fingers (secondary button). GNOME on Wayland support a three-finger &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; or &ldquo;zoom&rdquo; gesture that activates the GNOME Activities screen; it worked as expected with the Magic Trackpad 2. The Magic Mouse 2 works fine as a mouse, with both primary button and secondary button working as expected, but without any scrolling functionality. The loss of scrolling functionality is OK with me, since I typically disable it anyway. If you want scrolling functionality, be aware that it didn&rsquo;t work for me under GNOME on X11.</p>
<h2 id="caveats-and-issues">Caveats and Issues</h2>
<p>Nothing significant, but a couple of things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s no straightforward way to check the charge level of either device. I haven&rsquo;t found any external visual indicators, and Fedora (Linux in general, as far as I can tell) isn&rsquo;t displaying that information, either. It&rsquo;s possible there&rsquo;s an obscure command I can run; I&rsquo;ll update this post if I find it.</li>
<li>Occasionally, two-finger scrolling on the Magic Trackpad 2 won&rsquo;t work; it&rsquo;s almost like the pressure sensitivity of the trackpad (to recognize multiple touch points) needs to be adjusted. Unfortunately, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an easy way to adjust it. Fortunately, thus far this behavior has been intermittent and easily resolved by shifting the placement of my fingers on the trackpad.</li>
<li>The Magic Mouse 2 retains the absurdly-stupid placement of the charging port on the bottom of the mouse, rendering it unusable while charging. I much rather would&rsquo;ve seen Apple redesign the mouse to allow a charging port at the &ldquo;top end&rdquo; of the mouse, even if the overall aesthetics of the mouse had to be altered as a result.</li>
<li><em>(Added after a week of usage)</em> As a Bluetooth device, the Magic Trackpad 2 does occasionally &ldquo;disconnect&rdquo; itself, and has issues reconnecting. I haven&rsquo;t been able to find any patterns here, so I switched to using it as a USB device (daisy-chained off my keyboard). It works fabulously as a USB device. <em>(Update: While my original testing was on Fedora 31, I&rsquo;ve also seen this behavior after upgrading to Fedora 32.)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m reasonably satisfied with both the Magic Mouse 2 and the Magic Trackpad 2 and their support for/in Linux. I hope this review has been helpful; feel free to connect with <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lowe">me on Twitter</a> if you have additional questions or other feedback. Thanks for reading!</p>
