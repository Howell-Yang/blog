  <p>As most of you probably know, I visit quite a few VMUG User Conferences around the United States and around the world. I&rsquo;d probably do even more if my calendar allowed, because it&rsquo;s truly an honor for me to have the opportunity to help educate the VMware user community. I know I&rsquo;m not alone in that regard; there are numerous VMware &ldquo;rock stars&rdquo; (not that I consider myself a &ldquo;rock star&rdquo;) out there who also work tirelessly to support the VMware community. One need not look very far to see some examples of these types of individuals: Mike Laverick, William Lam, Duncan Epping, Josh Atwell, Nick Weaver, Alan Renouf, Chris Colotti, Cody Bunch, or Cormac Hogan are all great examples. (And I&rsquo;m sure there are many, <em>many</em> more I&rsquo;ve forgotten!)</p>
<p>However, one thing that has consistently been a topic of discussion among those of us who frequent VMUGs has been this question: &ldquo;How do we get users more engaged in VMUG?&rdquo; VMUG is, after all, the VMware <em>User</em> Group. And while all of us are more than happy to help support VMUG (at least, I know I am), we&rsquo;d also like to see more user engagement&mdash;more customers speaking about their use cases, their challenges, the things they&rsquo;ve learned, and the things they want to learn. We want to see users get connected with other users, to share information and build a community-based body of knowledge. So how can we do that?</p>
<p>As I see it, there is a variety of reasons why users don&rsquo;t volunteer to speak:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They might be afraid of public speaking, or aren&rsquo;t sure how good they&rsquo;ll be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They feel like the information they could share won&rsquo;t be helpful or useful to others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t sure how to structure their presentation to make it informative yet engaging.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We (meaning a group of us that support a lot of these events) have tossed around a few ideas, but nothing has ever really materialized. Today I hope to change all that. <strong>Today, I&rsquo;m announcing that I will personally help mentor 5 different VMware users who are willing to step up and volunteer to speak <em>for the first time</em> at a local VMUG meeting in the near future.</strong></p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I will help you select a topic on which to speak (in coordination with your local VMUG leader).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will provide guidance and feedback on gathering your content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will review and provide feedback and suggestions for improving your presentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If desired, I will provide tips and tricks for public speaking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And I&rsquo;m calling on others within the VMUG community who are frequent speakers to do the same. I think that Mike Laverick might have already done something like this; perhaps the others have as well. If so, that&rsquo;s awesome. If not, I challenge you, as someone viewed in a technical leadership role within the VMware and VMUG communities, to use that leadership role in a way that I hope will reinvigorate and renew user involvement and participation in the VMware/VMUG community.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one of the 5 people who&rsquo;s willing to take me up on this offer, the first step is contact me and your local VMUG leader and express your interest. Don&rsquo;t have my e-mail address? Here&rsquo;s your first challenge: it&rsquo;s somewhere on this site.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re already a frequent speaker at VMUGs and you, too, want to help mentor other speakers, you can either post a comment here to that effect (and provide people with a way of getting in touch with you), or&mdash;if you have your own blog&mdash;I encourage you to make the same offer via your own site. Where possible, I&rsquo;ll try to update this (or you can use trackbacks) so that readers have a good idea of who out there is willing to provide assistance to help them become the next VMUG &ldquo;rock star&rdquo; presenter.</p>
<p>Good luck, and I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A few folks have noted that all the names I listed above are VMware employees, so I&rsquo;ve added a couple others who are not. Don&rsquo;t read too much into that; it was all VMware employees because I work at VMware, too, and they&rsquo;re the ones I communicate with frequently. There are lots of passionate and dedicated VMUG supporters out there&mdash;you know who you are!</p>
<p>Also, be sure to check the comments; a number of folks are volunteering to also mentor new speakers.</p>
