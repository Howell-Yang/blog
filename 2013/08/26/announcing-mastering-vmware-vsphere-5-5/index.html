  <p>Well, the title kind of says it all&mdash;yes, there <strong>will</strong> be an update to the popular <em>Mastering VMware vSphere 5</em> book, with new content for the vSphere 5.5 release announced today at VMworld. Availability of the new title is expected in late October or early November, but I believe it&rsquo;s already <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-VMware-vSphere-Scott-Lowe/dp/1118661141/ref=sr_1_3/183-8467773-3754858?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1377463800&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=mastering+vmware+vsphere">available for pre-order on Amazon.</a></p>
<p>However, this book represents more than just another title in the <em>Mastering VMware vSphere</em> series. It represents a &ldquo;changing of the guard,&rdquo; so to speak. In order to understand why, allow me to share with you the story of how my very first book, <em>Mastering VMware vSphere 4</em>, came to be. This is a story that very few people know.</p>
<p>I suppose the story starts in 2008. As a blogger, I&rsquo;d gained some visibility as a result of my liveblogging at VMworld 2007, and in 2008 I met Chad Sakac. Chad is now a hugely popular figure within the VMware community, but at the time he was &ldquo;just&rdquo; the leader of a little-known group within EMC. (This is the group that would later become known as the vSpecialists.) Chad and I chatted, geeked out on some VMware stuff, and became buddies. I didn&rsquo;t really think too much about the connection; we were just a couple of virtualization geeks making a connection.</p>
<p>Then came early 2009. Chad contacted me, and said he&rsquo;d been approached about writing a book. Unfortunately, he was unable to write the book; would I be interested in writing it, he asked. Heck yeah! Writing a book had been an item on my bucket list for a really long time. So Chad made the connections to Wiley/Sybex, contracts were signed, and at VMworld 2009 <em>Mastering VMware vSphere 4</em> was released, quickly becoming a massive hit. I joined Chad&rsquo;s vSpecialist team in 2010, and remained there for 3 years before transitioning to VMware earlier this year to focus on network virtualization.</p>
<p>Looking back on this series of events, it&rsquo;s easy to see that this was a huge opportunity I&rsquo;d received. So, when it came time to discuss writing the book that would become <em>Mastering VMware vSphere 5.5</em>, I asked myself: &ldquo;I was just <em>given</em> this opportunity. Can I do the same for someone else? Can I pay this forward?&rdquo; It was at that point I decided that I would not be the lead author for the next revision; instead, I would pass the torch on to someone else&mdash;someeone else who had &ldquo;Write a book&rdquo; on their bucket list. I wanted to give someone else the same opportunity I&rsquo;d been given.</p>
<p>This is why <em>Mastering VMware vSphere 5.5</em> represents a changing of the guard. This book embodies my decision to pay it forward, to give another worthy individual&mdash;in this case, Nick Marshall&mdash;the opportunity to do something he really wanted to do. Many of you know Nick; he&rsquo;s been involved in the VMware community in a number of ways, through support of the vBrownbag Podcast as well as through his work with Alastair Cooke on AutoLab. In addition to that, he&rsquo;s just a really nice guy, and that counts for something, too. I&rsquo;m really thrilled that Nick has taken the lead with this book, and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to seeing where he takes the <em>Mastering VMware vSphere</em> series.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re looking for an authoritative reference to the vSphere 5.5 release, I would encourage you to pick up <em>Mastering VMware vSphere 5.5</em>. Nick and I, along with our co-conspirators Forbes Guthrie, Josh Atwell, and Matt Liebowitz, have done our best to produce something that is useful and informative. I hope that you agree.</p>
