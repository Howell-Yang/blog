  <p>Almost six years ago I shared <a href="/2010/05/02/my-current-getting-things-done-setup/">my (then) current Getting Things Done (GTD) setup</a>, in which I described how I used various tools, techniques, and applications to try to maximize my productivity. I&rsquo;d been toying with updating that post, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure that anyone would find it useful. However, a recent e-mail from a reader indicated that there probably <em>is</em> some interest; with that in mind, then, here&rsquo;s an update on my GTD-like setup, circa early 2016.</p>
<p>Before I dive into the details, a couple quick notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I call this a &ldquo;GTD-like&rdquo; setup because it doens&rsquo;t necessarily strongly adhere to <em>all</em> the tenets of Getting Things Done. I&rsquo;ve adapted the system to fit my particular role and responsibilities, which is something I strongly encourage every reader to also do.</li>
<li>Although I&rsquo;ve previously discussed <a href="/2012/11/30/why-i-might-leave-os-x/">moving away from OS X</a> (and this is something that I continue to evaluate and explore), this is&mdash;for now&mdash;a decidedly Mac-specific system. It&rsquo;s probably possible to emulate a similar system on other platforms, but I leave that as an exercise for interested readers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you read the 2010 post, you may recall that I think of my workflow as having three &ldquo;layers&rdquo; of applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; layer: This is where information to be processed enters the system (i.e., is consumed). Applications in this layer are things like Apple Mail (for e-mail, obviously, but with <a href="http://indev.ca/MailTags.html">the invaluable MailTags plug-in</a>), <a href="http://netnewswireapp.com/mac/">NetNewsWire</a> (for RSS feeds; I run an older version that still supports AppleScript), <a href="https://www.codeux.com/textual/">Textual</a> (for IRC), <a href="http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/">Tweetbot</a> (for Twitter), <a href="https://adium.im/">Adium</a> (for instant messaging), and Safari (for web content).</li>
<li>The &ldquo;organization&rdquo; layer: This is where things get organized. I say &ldquo;things&rdquo; here because there are two distinct types of items: commitments and information. I believe this distinction is necessary&mdash;an incoming e-mail from your boss may result in a commitment (something you need to do) or may just be information (that you need to save and make available). These things need to be handled differently. I&rsquo;ll discuss this in a bit more detail shortly.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;creation&rdquo; layer: This is where I create output based on input arriving via the consumption layer, directed/assisted/guided by commitments and information in the organization layer. Applications I use here include <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/mac/microsoft-office-for-mac">Microsoft Office 2011</a> (when I have to exchange documents with other people; I haven&rsquo;t upgraded to the latest version), <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a>, or <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 3</a> (for writing Markdown, ASCIIDOC, reStructured Text, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a class of applications and tools that don&rsquo;t fall into these broad categories, but rather serve as &ldquo;helpers.&rdquo; This would include things like <a href="https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander">TextExpander</a>, <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a>, <a href="https://www.mindjet.com/mindmanager/">MindManager</a>, <a href="https://red-sweater.com/fastscripts/">FastScripts</a>, etc.</p>
<p>The consumption and creation layers are pretty straightforward, so I won&rsquo;t talk too much directly about them, with one exception: e-mail. It&rsquo;s critical that you take control of your e-mail, and&mdash;as I&rsquo;ve said before&mdash;<a href="/2013/06/21/reducing-the-friction-processing-e-mail/">stop <em>managing</em> e-mail and start <em>processing</em> e-mail</a>. In other words, an e-mail message generally isn&rsquo;t anything important in and of itself. Rather, it&rsquo;s what the e-mail message generates: an action (commitment) or some information. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> what really matters, not the e-mail message itself. OK, enough about that&hellip;</p>
<p>Instead, let&rsquo;s focus on the organization layer. As I did in 2010, I still use <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> to manage my commitments. (I did <a href="/2015/04/06/plain-text-productivity-experiment/">try a plain-text based system</a> as well as re-visit Things, but moved back to OmniFocus.) To make getting commitments into OmniFocus (hereafter just OF) easier, I still use a set of AppleScripts bound to a hotkey (using FastScripts) that will take information from the current application&mdash;an e-mail message in Apple Mail, or the current web page in Safari, for example&mdash;and create an action in OF. Obviously, some of the scripts I mentioned in <a href="/2010/05/02/my-current-getting-things-done-setup/">the 2010 article</a> are no longer applicable: Camino died a long time ago, I ditched Yojimbo (more on that in a moment), Twitterrific killed its AppleScript support (and I, in turn, moved to a different client), etc. However, the basic idea is still the same: use OF to keep track of all the various projects and actions (commitments), and make it as easy (frictionless) as possible to get stuff into OF.</p>
<p>Managing information is a bit more challenging in that there are many different <em>types</em> of information. For e-mail messages, I tag them (using MailTags) and file them away (using AppleScripts and hotkeys to streamline the process). For files, I use the file system. (Amazing concept, eh?) In 2010, I used a tool called <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/Yojimbo/">Yojimbo</a>. Yojimbo had a few quirks that I couldn&rsquo;t work around, so I <a href="/2011/09/07/switching-to-eaglefiler/">switched to EagleFiler</a>. EagleFiler was nice in that it leveraged the underlying file system, which then caused me to ask: why couldn&rsquo;t I just leverage the file system? That led me to a file system-based approach using a defined naming convention (based on the ISO 8601 date format) and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/openmeta/">OpenMeta</a> tags, which I described a bit <a href="/2012/07/25/advanced-spotlight-queries-in-the-mac-gui/">here</a>. When OS X Mavericks came out and I finally upgraded, I moved away from OpenMeta tags to native Finder tags, but the underlying approach remained the same: use the defined structure and naming convention, along with tags, to store information, then use Spotlight and/or <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a> (a recent addition to my portfolio) to find the information I need later. This is a process I&rsquo;m still optimizing through the use of tools like <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> (to automatically apply tags based on predefined conditions or triggers).</p>
<p>For note-based information, I tried (multiple times) to use a tool like Evernote, but it just didn&rsquo;t/doesn&rsquo;t fit into my workflow. Instead, I use a series of text files stored in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> folder (using my naming convention and tags, of course). For URLs, I capture the URL as a <code>.webloc</code> file (using an AppleScript bound to a hotkey, of course!), which can be opened on OS X or iOS (and, as it turns out, is an XML file so it&rsquo;s not that hard to extract the URL on other OSes as well). Since it&rsquo;s then a file, then it falls back under the guidelines for organizing files (I store these on Dropbox as well).</p>
<p>There you have it&mdash;an update on my organizational/productivity setup as of early 2016. If you have any questions or feedback, I&rsquo;d love to hear them; feel free to e-mail me (my address is on this site) or <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lowe">hit me up on Twitter</a>. Thanks for reading, and I hope you find something useful here!</p>
