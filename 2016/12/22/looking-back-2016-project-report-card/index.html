  <p>As I&rsquo;ve done for the last few years, in early 2016 I published <a href="/2016/01/21/looking-ahead-2016-projects/">a list of my planned personal projects for the year</a>. In this post, I&rsquo;d like to look back on that list of projects and grade myself on my progress (or lack of progress, if that is the case). Even though 2016 isn&rsquo;t over yet, it&rsquo;s close enough to the end of the year that things won&rsquo;t change that much before 2017 is upon us.</p>
<p>For reference, here&rsquo;s the list of planned 2016 projects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete a new book (again)</li>
<li>Make more open source contributions</li>
<li>Expand my knowledge and use of Python</li>
<li>Expand my knowledge, use, and focus on public cloud services</li>
<li>Complete a &ldquo;wildcard project&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at each of these planned projects and see how I fared.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Complete a new book (again):</em> Well&mdash;in the spirit of total honesty and transparency&mdash;this was a major failure. Not only did I fail to complete <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920042082.do">the network automation book</a> I&rsquo;ve been working on with Matt Oswalt and Jason Edelman, but the <em>other</em> book project I had planned also did not go anywhere. Granted, the circumstances preventing the second book project were outside my control, but the fact remains I still did not get a new book published this past year. Grade: <strong>F</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Make more open source contributions:</em> This is another area I continue to struggle. While I make &ldquo;contributions&rdquo; (in a very loose sense of the word) to various open source projects through blogging and education, it&rsquo;s still not the same. In 2016, I made <em>zero</em> contributions to any significant open source project. Shame on me. Grade: <strong>F</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Expand my knowledge and use of Python:</em> I certainly did not make the progress I had hoped to make this past year, but I <em>did</em> make progress. I&rsquo;m finding I&rsquo;m able to &ldquo;decipher&rdquo; Python code more easily than in the past, but I still have a great deal of learning ahead of me. Naturally, as you can imagine based on the my evaluation so far, I did not make the stretch goal. Grade: <strong>D</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Expand my knowledge, use, and focus on public cloud services:</em> Here, finally, I feel like I&rsquo;ve made some reasonable progress. I focused on AWS this past year, mostly because they are considered the &ldquo;leader&rdquo; in public cloud services. (Whether they remain there is, of course, the subject of quite a bit of debate among the &ldquo;clouderati.&rdquo;) Over the course of the year, I generated 24 blog posts sharing what I&rsquo;ve learned along the way. I now feel much more comfortable with architecting solutions on AWS. There&rsquo;s still lots to learn, of course. I did not make the stretch goal of achieving a certification of some sort. Grade: <strong>C</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Complete a &ldquo;wildcard project&rdquo;:</em> As was the case last year, assessing my performance here is challenging. I don&rsquo;t have a clear &ldquo;stand out&rdquo; wildcard project this year like I did last year. There are lots of little things: I continued to make contributions to <a href="https://github.com/scottslowe/learning-tools">my &ldquo;learning-tools&rdquo; repo</a>, including expanding support to other virtualization providers; I took on a couple first-time VMUG speakers as mentees; I helped track down and verify a few bugs in some open source projects (but didn&rsquo;t contribute code to fix the bugs); and I continued to support the VMUG community through numerous appearances at VMUG UserCon events worldwide. These are all fine things to have accomplished, but none of them stands out as a &ldquo;wildcard project&rdquo; to me. Grade: <strong>D</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, in summary: pretty awful! Yes, there were some bright spots over the course of the year, but I failed to achieve almost all of the goals/milestones I&rsquo;d set for myself at the start of the year. As I mentioned earlier, I suppose some slack is due since some of these were affected by circumstances outside my control; however, the fact remains that I did not make the progress on these projects that I&rsquo;d hoped/planned to make.</p>
<p>The most appropriate thing to do now is ask myself some hard questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why</em> didn&rsquo;t I make the progress I wanted to make?</li>
<li><em>What</em> things&mdash;technological or otherwise&mdash;stood in my way?</li>
<li><em>How</em> can I address these issues in the coming year?</li>
</ul>
<p>Times like these can be times of growth, if approached correctly, and I want to be sure to learn as much as I can from this review of the past year&rsquo;s (lack of) progress. In the next few weeks, I&rsquo;ll use whatever I learn as I plan for 2017&rsquo;s projects. Once those projects are ready to be shared, I&rsquo;ll share them here as I have in the past.</p>
<p>While there may be a couple more blog posts before 2017 arrives, I&rsquo;d like to take this moment and thank everyone for taking the time to visit the site and read my posts over the last year. Thanks for making 2016 a great year, and here&rsquo;s looking forward to a great 2017!</p>
