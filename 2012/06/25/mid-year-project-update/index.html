  <p>In early January, I posted <a href="/2012/01/02/some-projects-for-2012/">a 2012 project list</a>. To summarize, here are the four broad goals that I set for myself for 2012:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn to script in Perl.</li>
<li>Learn to speak German.</li>
<li>Become very familiar with the Xen hypervisor.</li>
<li>Pursue CCNP certification.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we are halfway through the year, where do things stand? Here&rsquo;s a quick update.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>My Perl skills are still really elementary. The biggest challenge I&rsquo;ve found is that without some sort of task or process to try to automate, trying to write code in Perl is kind of &ldquo;disconnected.&rdquo; Yes, you can walk through the sample code and the exercises in the book, but to make it real you need a relevant challenge. I&rsquo;ve been searching for some common tasks to try to automate, but haven&rsquo;t had a great deal of success yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My German is progressing, but ever so slowly. I&rsquo;m right now about one-third of the way through the Rosetta Stone modules I have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning Xen is also progressing. I do have a Xen Cloud Platform (XCP) system up and running in my home office; I&rsquo;ve been installing and re-installing it so as to get a better feel for the intricacies involved. It&rsquo;s currently broken&mdash;time for another rebuild!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have created the study framework for key topics on the CCNP ROUTE exam and am now adding content to the study framework. I haven&rsquo;t yet taken any exams, so I guess you could say I haven&rsquo;t really made any measurable progress on this goal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, I haven&rsquo;t made the progress that I would have liked to make, given the timeframe. Not to make excuses, but there are two factors that have affected me more significantly than I had anticipated: travel and <a href="/2012/04/06/announcement-vmware-vsphere-training-video/">my video training project with Train Signal</a>. Of the limited progress that I have made, most of it was in Q1, before I started my Train Signal project. Since I started the video training series, my travel has also picked up, and I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to work on the video series while I&rsquo;m traveling. Thus, the video training series has taken a lot more of my time than I had originally expected, and has stalled progress on my other initiatives.</p>
<p>So is a &ldquo;mid-course correction&rdquo; necessary? I think that it is. Here are the changes I&rsquo;m making:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning Perl:</strong> At this point, I&rsquo;m putting my Perl efforts on hold. For me, the biggest obstacle in learning to script in Perl was having relevant tasks that need to be scripted, and that&rsquo;s where I came up short. I simply couldn&rsquo;t find tasks that I wanted or needed to automate in Perl. A number of readers commented on my original article that my choice of projects wasn&rsquo;t particularly synergistic, and perhaps that is what is being reflected here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning German:</strong> To help encourage me to work on my German more frequently, I&rsquo;m going to change the OmniFocus actions so that I need to complete modules on a more regular basis. (As I&rsquo;ve written before <a href="/2008/02/16/getting-things-done-on-my-mac-part-ii/">elsewhere</a>, I use OmniFocus to help keep me on track with projects and responsibilities.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning Xen:</strong> I&rsquo;m continuing with Xen. Progress has been slow, but there has been progress. Several readers suggested I focus on KVM instead, but for now I&rsquo;m going to stick it out with Xen. The primary challenge here has been finding good sources of information. Don&rsquo;t be too surprised to see some blog posts as I wrestle through certain areas; perhaps these posts can be helpful to others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pursue CCNP:</strong> My pursuit of CCNP will continue. I already have study framework documents created, and I hope to turn up a router simulation environment (using GNS3 or similar) soon. From the beginning I never intended to actually attain CCNP by year end (that&rsquo;s 3 exams), but simply to make measurable progress (1 exam passed).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s where things stand, halfway through 2012. Perhaps these goals are ambitious, but I do believe that it&rsquo;s necessary to challenge ourselves, to never remain static and dormant&mdash;otherwise we risk becoming irrelevant in a fast-paced world of changing technologies.</p>
<p>I welcome any suggestions, thoughts, or criticisms (courteous and constructive, of course!) in the comments below.</p>
