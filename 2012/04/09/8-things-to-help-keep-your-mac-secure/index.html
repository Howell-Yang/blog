  <p>As the recent spate of Mac-specific malware shows, Mac OS X is not immune to security problems. (Not that this is really surprising to anyone.) To be honest, though, I was&mdash;until recently&mdash;fairly confident that my systems were reasonably secure. However, a Twitter conversation with security guru Christofer Hoff (aka <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/beaker">@Beaker</a>) convinced me that I wasn&rsquo;t doing enough. The appearance of the Flashback.K trojan, which can install itself even without administrative privileges, confirmed that he was right&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t doing enough. (No, I didn&rsquo;t get infected.)</p>
<p>Upon thinking about it a bit more, I realized that if <em>I</em> wasn&rsquo;t doing enough as a pretty savvy user, then a lot of people probably weren&rsquo;t doing enough. So, here&rsquo;s a breakdown of my Mac defense strategy. Perhaps sharing what I&rsquo;m doing with others will encourage them to improve their security posture as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>I use the BSD-level <code>ipfw</code> firewall.</strong> Mac OS X is, at its core, built on FreeBSD. This powerful UNIX layer offers an equally powerful stateful firewall in the form of <code>ipfw</code>. If you aren&rsquo;t using <code>ipfw</code>, I&rsquo;d encourage you to take a long, hard look at starting to use it. It provides a powerful ruleset to give you tremendous control over the types of traffic that are allowed into (and out of) your Mac. To help encourage people to use it, I recently published an article on <a href="/2012/04/05/setting-up-ipfw-on-mac-os-x/">how to configure ipfw on Mac OS X</a>.(Keep in mind that Mac OS X 10.7 &ldquo;Lion&rdquo; prefers <code>pf</code> instead of <code>ipfw</code>. I hope to post an article on that soon as well.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I use the built-in Mac OS X application-level firewall.</strong> Mac OS X ships with a pretty GUI for a built-in application-level firewall in System Preferences. I recommend that you turn it on, and select which applications you want to accept incoming connections. Some people have asked &ldquo;Why both firewalls?&rdquo; This is a fair question. The built-in application-level firewall simply allows or denies inbound traffic on a per-application level, but doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;to my knowledge&mdash;offer any more granularity than that. Using the built-in application-level firewall in conjunction with the BSD-level <code>ipfw</code> (or <code>pf</code>) firewall gives you the ability to specify which source addresses or networks are allowed to make connections to applications. This means that you can allow iTunes connections at the built-in firewall layer, and then use <code>ipfw</code> (or <code>pf</code>) to only allow connections from your home network subnet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I use an outbound application-level firewall.</strong> The built-in Mac OS X firewall in System Preferences only controls inbound traffic. What about outbound traffic? Do you know what processes and applications on your system are communicating with the outside world? I use <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html">Little Snitch</a>, which I believe to be an excellent choice in this area. (No, I don&rsquo;t have any affiliation with Objective Development.) Little Snitch gives you the visibility to know what applications and processes are communicating and on which protocols and ports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I use an account without administrative privileges for my day-to-day use.</strong> While this won&rsquo;t thwart all security problems&mdash;Flashback.K still works, for example&mdash;it&rsquo;s still a good idea. I also recommend that you only install applications using a separate account with administrative privileges. This forces you to log off, log on as the administrative user, then install your application(s). While this is a bit of a hassle, the security trade-off is, in my opinion, worth it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I disabled the opening of &ldquo;Safe&rdquo; files.</strong> Safari has this feature enabled by default. I recommend that you turn it off, and check to make sure it&rsquo;s turned off in other applications as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I use an AV application.</strong> Yes, yes, I know&mdash;Macs don&rsquo;t get viruses. Tell that to the 600,000 Macs infected with the Flashback trojan. And while Flashback isn&rsquo;t <em>technically</em> a virus, at this point you&rsquo;re just splitting hairs. I&rsquo;m using the free <a href="http://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools/sophos-antivirus-for-mac-home-edition.aspx">Sophos AV Home Edition for the Mac</a> and feel that it is pretty good, but there are numerous others. Find one and use it. (This is a recent addition to my own security strategy.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I do my best to stay updated.</strong> I encourage you to run Software Update on a regular basis. If you&rsquo;ve followed the advice of #4, this means you&rsquo;ll need to log in as an administrator and run Software Update. Make it a point to check regularly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t run the standalone Adobe Flash Player.</strong> Instead, I use Google Chrome when Flash is required, which comes with its owned patched version of Adobe Flash that is generally regarded (last time I checked) to be a bit safer than the standalone version of Flash. Yes, this means that I need to switch back and forth between browsers (Safari for day-to-day use, Chrome for Flash use), but this is a task that AppleScript easily solves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While these 8 things aren&rsquo;t going to guarantee that my Mac (or yours, should you choose to follow them as well) will never be exploited, I do feel that they provide a reasonable level of protection. Safe computing (and safe browsing) is still required; no amount of security can protect against stupidity. But when combined with security awareness and safe computing/browsing, I feel that these measures will provide the level of protection that I need.</p>
<p>(BTW, there are other network-level protections that I have in place as well, but I didn&rsquo;t include them here as the focus of this article is on the Mac itself.)</p>
<p>If you have any additional suggestions for helping keep your Mac secure, please feel free to speak up in the comments. Every suggestion can help!</p>
